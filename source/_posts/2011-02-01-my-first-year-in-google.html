title: My first year in Google
published: true
---
<p>That went by a lot faster than I thought it would. &nbsp;Today (February 1st) completes my full first year in Google.</p>
<p />
<div>It has been a crazy ride. Google is like no place that I have worked before, and I can honestly say it has been an amazing first year, I have met so many amazing people that I can't count. &nbsp;It is pretty amazing that I work for a company that is talked about everyday by billions of people on the planet.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>How I came to be at Google</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I had built a Twitter based web-app that was pretty damn popular, I sold it and quit my job full-time job (I still had to work a 3 month notice period). &nbsp;I had some ideas for a start-up that I wanted to&nbsp;pursue&nbsp;(it was a good idea - honest). &nbsp;A couple of days after I quit I got a call from one of the PM's on the Google App Engine who I had been talking too quite frequently over the previous months about a job opening. &nbsp;It is probably worth explaining that all of my apps were built upon the App Engine, and I was quite active in the App Engine forums and Twitter Developer forums (see my rant about Re-tweets ;) and I was implementing a lot of the latest features in my apps.</div>
<p />
<div>My onsite interview was on the 8th of December, and I believe on the 15th I was offered the job as long as I got over the final hurdle (final sign-off). By the 23rd I was properly offered the job - contract and all. &nbsp;At my interview I was "advised" not to take the first offer and hold out for a better packet..... however once the call came through with the terms, there was no way I was going to say no :)</div>
<p />
<div><strong>At Google</strong></div>
<p />
<div>My entire first month was spent in the Mountain View campus. &nbsp;It was awesome. &nbsp;I met so many amazing people. I can't really say much about what happens in a Nooglers first month - other than you are overloaded with information. &nbsp;If you have ever seen the Matrix when Neo learns Kung-fu in 5 seconds, it's like that (without the brain plug). &nbsp;Oh and yes, you do have to wear the hat!</div>
<p />
<div>I joined as a Developer Programmes Engineer for iGoogle and Google Chrome; I didn't realise it but I had joined a team with so many industry experts, people like Chris Messina and Tim Bray. These were guys that I had followed for a long time, and now I get to work with them. &nbsp;When I started, I was the 2nd person of a two man team in London it made sense to cover two products. &nbsp;The team has grown a lot over the year and now I&nbsp;solely&nbsp;focus on Chrome (HTML5 and the Webstore). &nbsp;We have an amazing set of developers on the team now in London (@reto_meir - from the start, @mahemoff, @crafty,&nbsp;@ade_oshineye, @tekgrrl and @ccherubino).</div>
<div>
<p />
<div>Google IO - I joined after all the talks had been decided, so it was not possible for me to do one. &nbsp;I helped out on two hack-booths and at one of the stands. &nbsp;It was a pretty amazing experience, it the first time that I stayed in San Francisco (I probably won't be doing that too often). &nbsp;An event with so many massive&nbsp;announcements&nbsp;and so many developers. I have never seen anything like it, plus everyone who attended got two phones, unless you were a Googler and all you got was a yellow t-shirt.</div>
<p />
<div>I have travelled so much this year,&nbsp;actually, I quickly calculated that I have travelled more this year than I have in my entire 29 years of life before Google. &nbsp;I have also given quite a lot of presentations over the last year too (<a href="http://gdd-2010.appspot.com/">http://gdd-2010.appspot.com/</a> and <a href="http://londonwebstorenight.appspot.com/">http://londonwebstorenight.appspot.com/</a> are just a few).</div>
<p />
<div>Around late June, I shifted roles slightly; I became a Developer Advocate. &nbsp;The distinction between the roles is not great, DPE's do more behind the scenes work and DA's will engage with partners more, potentially at an earlier stage. &nbsp;But change in role reflected the outreach work that I have been doing for most of the year.</div>
<p />
<div>In late October we went on a massive Road Trip around Europe giving talks to thousands of Developers in Munich, Moscow and Prague for the Google Developer Days. &nbsp;We didn't get to stay long in Munich or Moscow, but we managed to stay the weekend in Prague - it is one of the most beautiful cities that I have ever been in (and the beer was good too). &nbsp;All the events were IMO very good, even the wifi held up in many places. &nbsp;It was quite interesting to see the&nbsp;organisational&nbsp;differences between countries, for example the Munich event had 15 minute breaks between each talk (which worked really well) and the Moscow event was HUUUUUGGGGEEE and held in a massive arena - through my british eyes, some of the&nbsp;stereotypes&nbsp;that we see portrayed played out amazingly well - and that is a good thing because each of these events were amazing.</div>
<p />
<div>In December we launched the Chrome Webstore. &nbsp;I had worked with the team on this pretty much since I joined Google. &nbsp;It has been an amazing project to work on and to see the genesis of a movement towards an app-centric view of the web. &nbsp;There is a strong future for web-apps as developers learn to move away from some of the traditional web-isms that we see in websites and build apps and not sites with a bit of functionality in.</div>
</div>
<p />
<div>Throughout the year I have worked with hundreds of&nbsp;developers&nbsp;helping them build awesome web-apps for the open web. &nbsp;It has been an amazing experience. &nbsp;Oh and I got my first commit in Chrome ;)</div>
<p />
<div><strong>The Future</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I honestly have no idea what this year holds, other than being twice as big as the previous year and I now that I know a little more about how everything works I should be a lot more efficient.</div>
<p />
<div>I am hoping to be talking at Google IO. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>I will be working with more developers and helping them build awesome web apps.</div>
<p />
<div>I will be spending more time working with people outside of London. &nbsp;My focus this year has been very much focused on the capital, but the development community isn't just based here.</div>
<p />
<div>I will be spending more time at home in Liverpool :)</div>
