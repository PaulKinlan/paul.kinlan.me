title: XNA Parallax Engine and the GSE Beta 2
published: true

<p>Just a quick update to say that I am about to start converting the current Parallax Engine to GSE Beta, I belive I need to do this because of the significant changes that have taken place since beta 1.  Most of all the Game Designers have been removed.</p> <p>I really like the idea of having Game Designers so that you can quickly configure the basic components that you are using on your game, however to get 360 support they have had to be dropped.</p> <p> </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Tags: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/XNA" rel="tag">XNA</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/parallax" rel="tag">parallax</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/GSE" rel="tag">GSE</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/GameComponents" rel="tag">GameComponents</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/GameComponent" rel="tag">GameComponent</a>
