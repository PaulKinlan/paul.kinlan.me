title: Wii, oh Wii did I cancel my Wii
published: true

<p>A couple of months ago I pre-ordered a Nintendo Wii on Argos, however I cancelled the order..... which was a silly thing to do because it meant that I have not been able to find one since the launch in the UK.  Everyone else in work got theirs and have been talking about how cool it is, and all I could do was wobble my bottom lip and long for a Wii, that is until now!</p> <p>I got mine yesterday (5th Jan 2007) from Asda in Aintree, Liverpool.  They had 3 in stock at the time. I also bought the last Wii Play that they had.  I only got it by chance, I decided to ring around some shops like Game (they are rubbish, they never answer the phone and are pretty rude most of the time when you do get a chance to speak to them) and Game Station, it was only a fluke that I thought I might try Asda.</p> <p>I got the box home and set the box it up later that night and we played on it for an hour or two.  I absolutly love it,  I think it is a brilliant piece of kit, the Wiimote seems pretty accurate and the WiiSports graphics are really cute!  The graphics are not as good as the 360, but that doesn't matter because it appears to be all about the games.</p> <p>I haven't set up the Wireless access yet because I need a wireless router! Doh :)</p> <p>Nintendo have had a stroke of genius here, it is reported that they are making a profit on every piece of hardware that they sell unlike some of other Next Gen Consoles have at their launch, and they are sold out nearly straight away.</p> <p>Anyway, I can't wait to get more games for it.  Let me know if you have any suggestions or know any cool links for Wii and i'll post it here.</p> <p> </p><div class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Topicala Tags: <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/Wii" rel="tag">Wii</a>, <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/Argos" rel="tag">Argos</a>, <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/Asda" rel="tag">Asda</a>, <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/Wii%20Play" rel="tag">Wii Play</a>, <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/Nintendo" rel="tag">Nintendo</a>, <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/WiiSports" rel="tag">WiiSports</a>
