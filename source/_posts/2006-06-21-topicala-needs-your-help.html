title: Topicala Needs your Help
published: true
---
I need as many peoples helps as I can get. I am setting up a hierarchical tag directory and I need people to help me populate it.<p />You can add tags in to the database by simply searching for a topic via the web interface, or you can also use standard http GET requests via my “API”. Simply type in your browser address bar <a href="http://www.topicala.com/api/add/">http://www.topicala.com/api/add/</a>[TagName]<p />To make it hierarchical, it would be a great help if people could put a parent topical category by using the input box on the search results. For example if you seach for C#, a parent topic would be Programming Languages, or musical Notes.<p />You can also use the API to add a parent topical tag in by using the following query string <a href="http://www.topicala.com/api/add/">http://www.topicala.com/api/add/</a>[ParentTag]/[ChildTag]. If either the child tag or the parent tag don’t exist in the database then it will automatically create them.<p />Once I have a good corpus of information, I will enable it so that it will be easier for people to filter their topical search results through topicala.<p />I really appreciate any help you can give me!<p />Cheers<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-115092206806808519?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
