title: Removed my feed from Squeet

I have removed my feed from squeet.  I was getting a lot of problems where by it would send me about 5 or 6 updates to my old posts a day.  Not many people were subscribing to it, so I have removed it from my site to stop any more problems.<img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-115389970749578378?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" />
