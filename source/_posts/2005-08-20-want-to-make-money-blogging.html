title: Want to make money blogging
published: true

It seems that if you want to make money blogging, you have to blog about making money blogging. The more you blog about making money the more money you make! Or so it seems.<p />A case in point is made here, <a href="http://www.problogger.net/">http://www.problogger.net/</a> . <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/01/06/about-darren/">Darren Rowse </a>reported that he has made a Six Figure salary a month off Blogging, and what does he do (It is actually more than a blog about making money blogging) he seems to eat, sleep, dream and talk about blogging. I think the site is quite interesting, but I don't ever intend on competing with him that much.<p />He does have some good pointers about site design, content and the like. And a neat comment<br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">I am sorry that you are offended by me earning money from blogging. A guy has to<br />support his family somehow and I figure it might as well be by helping people on<br />the net by providing them with the information that they are searching for.</blockquote><p>Lucky Man! I think I should stick to my day job though. </p><p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
