title: ".Net Developers: SVN vs Mercurial pt2"
published: true

So, after some thought, some replies (mostly favouring SVN) I have chosen to go with Mercurial as the VCS for the project that I am working on.<p /><div>The reason being, is that although I won&#39;t be hosting on Codeplex, they support Mercurial and there are plenty of tools that .Net developers can use to bind to the SCM and the fact that it is a distribute system means it wins in my eyes.  I will need decent branching support and I have never been a fan of SVN&#39;s branching mechanism.</div> <p /><div>I am willing to be educated more if you have any compelling reasons for me not to go with Subversion.</div>
