Posterous has been great for me, but now it is time to move it.

I don't have the time to do this so I am very willing to pay someone a
modest fee for managing the move of my blog to a platform that meets the
following requirements:

Mandatory Requirements:
- not a hosted solution like Blogger or Tumblr
- static output (no database)
- can write posts in markdown, text or html
- all content can be managed through git.
- URL structure is kept exactly the same as now
- will keep all the posts that I imported into posterous from blogger.
- full control over templates

Nice to haves:
- preferably not a ruby based system

Not bothered about:
- any authoring or management front end.
- auto posting networks
- existing comments or future commenting systems
