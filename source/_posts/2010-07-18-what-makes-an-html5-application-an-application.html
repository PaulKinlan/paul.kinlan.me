title: What makes an HTML5 Application an Application
published: true
---
We have been thinking about what properties of an HTML application <br />make it an application rather than a webpage with logic. <p /> We have documented our thoughts here: <br /><a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/apps/articles/thinking_in_web_apps.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/apps/articles/thinking_in_web_apps.html</a> <br />(Thinking in Apps). This is only the start of our thinking and work on <br />what hopefully will become a robust guide to patterns in web <br />application development. <p /> Many of the things that define a great web page experience are also <br />the same things that describe an application experience on the web, <br />however we think there are some subtle differences, especially around <br />the use of client side data storage, offline support and user <br />experience. <p /> For example our focus on user experience is key. Applications should <br />do what they do well, by only concentrating on the task that the user <br />wants to perform. Combine this with our idea of making better use of <br />the browser real-estate by laying out your applications differently <br />and removing extraneous content such as footers, menus and logos plus <br />(I.e, traditional webpage design); you start to see some compelling <br />differences. <p /> We are keen to hear your thoughts so leave a comment, examples and thoughts.
