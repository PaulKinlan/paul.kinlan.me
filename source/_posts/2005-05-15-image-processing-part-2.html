There is a really cool (At least I think it is) Image Processing Library (Tiger Imaging) for C# <a href="http://www.thecodeproject.com/cs/media/Image_Processing_Lab.asp/tag" rel="tag" target="_blank">here</a> (Code Project). It comes with complete source code and provides some really cool filters that enable you to perform a bit of image manipluation easily. It is by a guy called <a href="http://www.thecodeproject.com/script/profile/whos_who.asp?id=1181072"><strong>Andrew Kirillov</strong></a> and he has another article on the code project here where he demonstrates <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cs/media/Motion_Detection.asp#xx1098757xx" target="_blank">Montion Capture</a> using his library.<p />I am just wondering if I should create some filters (such as <a href="http://www.jasonwaltman.com/thesis/filter-fisheye.html" target="_blank">fish eye</a> that <a href="http://www.jasonwaltman.com/" target="_blank">Jason Waltman</a> describes). I have some plans for doing a bit of research with Tiger Imaging....<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-111616540619244356?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
