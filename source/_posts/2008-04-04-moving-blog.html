<p>I have been using Blogger for many years now on my own server. It has got to the point where I don't find the features of blogger fit in with my needs as a blogging platform so I am moving to Wordpress.</p> <p>I am keeping all the content here on this site and I may still update it from now and then.</p> <p>The new blog will still be more broadly focused against all aspects of the development of software not just c#.  The new blog can be found at the following URL: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/blog/">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/blog/</a></p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-392238863958976180?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
