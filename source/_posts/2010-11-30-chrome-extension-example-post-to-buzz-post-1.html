<p>The other day I post a simple Chrome extension that allows you to post the
current page to Google Buzz, but also allows you to see how popular the
current page is on Buzz.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of posts, I will use this app to show you how to build
a Chrome Extension and how easy it is to add some awesome features (and also
show you how cool Google Buzz is).</p>

<p>It is pretty neat, and pretty simple to create.  It uses the following
Chrome Extension features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Browser Actions, to let you &ldquo;Buzz This&rdquo;,</li>
<li>Tabs API, to determine the current page you are on,</li>
<li>Cross Domain Requests to allow you to get the number of &ldquo;Buzzes&rdquo; that
have been made about the current page,</li>
<li>Context Menu API to allow you to post images and links to Buzz &lt;&ndash; my
favourite feature.</li>
</ol>


<p>To get started, the extension is here:
