title: The skinny on LeviRoute JS routing framework

<p>If you follow me on Twitter &ndash; @<a href="http://twitter.com/paul_kinlan">Paul_Kinlan</a>
&ndash; you will know I yap on a lot about many of my projects on Github.  This
post is no exception, I want to introduce <a href="https://github.com/PaulKinlan/leviroutes">LeviRoutes</a>, a client-side JS routing
framework that is loosely based on a Rails like approach to URL handling.</p>

<p>There are plenty of frameworks that do this already so why did you create
this? I hear you ask.  Well it is pretty simple. I wanted a framework that
would:
 *  execute specific methods when the URL changed and matched a certain
pattern;
 *  is quick and easy to use;
 *  listened for changes in the URL fragment;
 *  worked with HTML5 History APIs;
 *  worked on browsers that don&rsquo;t support any of these features;
 *  and most importantly doesn&rsquo;t try to do anything else.</p>

<p>Thus LeviRoutes was born.  It came about because I am working on a project
that uses NodeJS with the Express framework, and the URL handling is very
simple to access and I wanted to replicate this behavior in the browser, not
just the server.  My ultimate goal is for me to be able to share a lot of
the logic that is on the server with the client and thus cut down the amount
of code that I need to do.</p>

<p>The LeviRoutes project started with juat the ability to listen to changes in
the HTML5 History by listening to the &ldquo;onpopstate&rdquo; event.  When there is a
&ldquo;pop&rdquo;, the matching code is invoked with the current window.location object.
 It later included a onhashchange event listener to listen to changes in
the fragment and finally included a listener for the onload event.  By
listening to these three events.</p>

<p>Lets have a look at the simplest app that we can build with this.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="kw">var</span> app = <span class="kw">new</span> routes();
app.get(<span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="k">/</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="kw">function</span>(req) { alert(<span class="s"><span class="dl">&quot;</span><span class="k">On /</span><span class="dl">&quot;</span></span>); });</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Pretty simple right!  Under the hood, the system is listening for when the
URL is just &ldquo;/&rdquo; and nothing more, if your URL was &ldquo;/index.html&rdquo; the code
would not be executed.  If you wanted to watch for when the URL is
&ldquo;/index.html&rdquo; you would need a route with that as the exact string.</p>

<p>Looking for just the root directory by itself is not very interesting, and
neither are simple static URL&rsquo;s.  Thus the named parameters from Rails and
other frameworks is built straight in, and this is the most interesting
part.</p>

<p>It also supports named parameters for route syntax:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>!#javascript
app.get(&quot;/:category&quot;, function(req) { alert(&quot;In &quot; + req.params.category); });
app.get(&quot;/:category.:format&quot;, function(req) { alert(&quot;format: &quot; + req.params.format); });</pre></div>
</div>


<p>This is simple, yet powerful, LeviRoutes allows you to treat the URL as an
input event to your controller, or as the controller.</p>
