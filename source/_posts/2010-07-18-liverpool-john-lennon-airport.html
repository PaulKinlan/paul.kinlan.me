 Currently stuck in Liverpool John Lennon airport. For all the <br />investment that has gone into this place I cannot believe the state it <br />is in. <p /> There are not enough chairs in the departure lounges, so when all the <br />planes are delayed (thank you easyjet) everyone has to either sit on <br />the dirty floor or lie against windows or stand for hours at a time. <p /> The restaurants don't clean up anywhere near enough. The place is grubby. <p /> Finally, the place is so hot, with no sense of air conditioning it is <br />nearly unbearable. The air is stuffy and clammy and only CDs to <br />already annoyed passengers distress. <p /> Your service levels have already made me decide that even though you <br />are my local airport I will always use Manchester first, heck I flew <br />from heathrow the other day and the 4am start from lime street was <br />much more pleasant than this place.
