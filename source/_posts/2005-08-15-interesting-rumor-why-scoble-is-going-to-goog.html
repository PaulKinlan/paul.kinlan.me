title: Interesting Rumor Why Scoble is Going to Google
published: true
---
I am only really posting this to see if I get recognised for starting a rumor.<p />Anyway Scoble asks:<br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">What I find funny is no one has started any interesting rumors about what I'm doing there. Sigh. People start all sorts of interesting rumors about Technorati, what does it take to get some creative writing going on?</blockquote><p />Well I reckon Robert is going to Google to see how they do things, only to have an NDA slapped on him so he can't let Microsoft know their plans!.<p />Or perhaps they want to show him some software that will create transcripts for channel 9 interviews?<p />erm... I can think of more.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-112414363040026796?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
