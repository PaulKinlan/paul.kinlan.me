    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just before Christmas I wanted to build a site that helped developers understand the impact that using Web Platform features would have on there potential reach.
For example, if I used WebGL what is my target reach and what additional features can I use without impacting my potential audience figures.  </p>

<p>I launched <a href="http://iwanttouse.com">iwanttouse.com</a>. Sweet. Anyway, that is not the point of this post.  One of the features of this site is.</p>

<p>One of the core features I wanted to implement was a traffic light system that graded the features like a traffic light. Green = Good, Red = Bad, Amber = Be Warned.  </p>

<p>My original implementation was just using some simple CSS classes.</p>

<pre><code>.good {
  color: green;
}

.ok {
  color: amber;
}

.bad {
  color: red;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I knew this was bad, but using RGB I couldn’t work out sanely how to grade between 255,0,0, 255,126,0 and 0,255,0 without having logic in my code that looked like:</p>

<pre><code>if (support &lt; 25%) then .bad
if (support &gt;25% and support &lt; 75%) then .ok
if (support &gt; 75%) then .good
</code></pre>

<p>added to that, I wanted the color to be more red than amber if it was at 35%.</p>

<p>Anyway, after a little chat with the awesome <a href="http://twitter.com/aerotwist">Paul Lewis</a>, he mentioned that <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/hsla/">HSL</a> (Hue, Saturation, Light) color scheme would be good for this problem
because naturally the Hue value (0-359) rotates from Red, through Amber to Green (0 = Red, 45 = Amber, 90 = Green)</p>

<p><span style="color: hsla(0, 50%, 50%, 1)">Red = <code>color: hsla(0, 50%, 50%, 1)</code></span>
<span style="color: hsla(45, 50%, 50%, 1)">Amber = <code>color: hsla(45, 50%, 50%, 1)</code></span>
<span style="color: hsla(90, 50%, 50%, 1)">Green = <code>color: hsla(90, 50%, 50%, 1)</code></span></p>

<p>It is then simple given a value for percentage support to map that to 0-90 range and produce your traffic light colors.</p>

<pre><code>element.styles.color = "hsla(" + ((percentage / 100) * 90) + ", 50%, 50%)";
</code></pre>
