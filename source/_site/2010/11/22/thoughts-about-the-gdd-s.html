<div class="entry-content">Last week I arrived back from the European Tour for the Google Developer Days.  We had 3 major events in about 10 days.  We started in Munich, moved to Moscow and finally visited Prauge in the Czech Republic. The whole trip was pretty damn amazing.<p /><div>I had two talks at each event, (apart from in Munich where we had an awesome local Chrome engineer give the talk - thanks Jochen).  The first talk was a Chrome Extension talk shared with @Mahemoff and was about developing Chrome extensions.</div> <p /><div>The slides for the Chrome Extensions talk can be found here: <a href="http://gdd-2010.appspot.com/Extension.crx">http://gdd-2010.appspot.com/Extension.crx</a> it all runs as a Chrome Extension, so you can quickly see the power of what can be achieved inside a Chrome extension by directly showing you the API&#39;s in action.  It must be noted, that this extension needs to run in experimental mode, which in the latest dev channel can be enabled by visiting about://flags.  I will put the code on Github soon.</div> <p /><div>The second talk at each event was about building great Web Apps.  I really enjoyed this talk, because it is a logical extension to the pure HTML5 talks that present the technology, and I presented some ideas for building great experiences for your users and how you can use the latest HTML5 API&#39;s and CSS3 attributes.</div> <p /><div>The slides for the building great Web Apps can be found here: <a href="http://gdd-2010.appspot.com/WebStore/index.html">http://gdd-2010.appspot.com/WebStore/index.html</a> again, I will put the code for these online soon so that everyone can see how we built them.</div> <div><br /><div>I met a lot of really enthusiastic developers over the course of the trip, most of which are building really great applications on the Web.  I met developers building protein sequencers, automatic app builders, games and much more.  It is amazing the amount of innovation that I saw directly from the developers that we don&#39;t get to see highlighted in the Tech Blogs.  I did find that a lot of developers don&#39;t travel with Business cards, I would really like to reach out to you, but I can&#39;t if don&#39;t know your email address :)</div> </div><p /><div>I have also attached some awesome photos of my travels and the events, so I hope you enjoy them.  Each of the cities were amazing, I managed to spend quite a bit of time in Prague and I loved the city.</div> <p>[[posterous-content:69j6DSAd1AD6ST44BB6s]]</p>
