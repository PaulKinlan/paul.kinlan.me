I am just about to visit Amsterdam on a business trip. The last time <br />I went to Amsterdam was when I was 7 (I think). I remember really <br />enjoying it then, granted I was 7 and I loved trams, but I am really <br />looking forward to visiting it again. <p /> What would people recommend to do if I have any free time over the <br />next two days? <p /> I plan in taking a couple of photos so I can at least try and document <br />some of this trip.
