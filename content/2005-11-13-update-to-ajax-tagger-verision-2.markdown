summary: 'I''ve updated my AJAX Tagger to Version 2!  This release adds a simple but
  useful feature: you can now manually add your own tags in the tag list panel. This
  is really helpful when the Yahoo Developer Term Extraction API isn''t sufficient
  for tagging, like when you need specific tags such as \"C#\" and \".Net\".'

title: Update To Ajax Tagger Verision 2

---
I have made an update to <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">AJAX Tagger Version 2</a>.  It is just a simple one, but you can now add in your own choice of tags from the tag list panel.  It was supposed to be in their from the start, but I never got around to doing it.  It helps a greatdeal for when the Yahoo Developer Term Extraction API is not enough.  Good examples are when you want "C#" and ".Net" to be a tag.<p />
