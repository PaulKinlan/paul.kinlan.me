I have made an update to <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">AJAX Tagger Version 2</a>.  It is just a simple one, but you can now add in your own choice of tags from the tag list panel.  It was supposed to be in their from the start, but I never got around to doing it.  It helps a greatdeal for when the Yahoo Developer Term Extraction API is not enough.  Good examples are when you want "C#" and ".Net" to be a tag.<p />
