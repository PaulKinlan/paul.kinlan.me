summary: This post compares the query limits of free search APIs from different providers.  It
  highlights that MSN Search API reportedly allows up to 10,000 queries per day, but
  whether that limit is per API or in total is still unclear. The post also notes
  that Google's Search API allows 1,000 queries per day, Yahoo's APIs allow 5,000
  queries per API per day, and Amazon's allows a generous 86,400 queries per day (calculated
  as 1 query per second).  More investigation is needed to confirm the exact limit
  for MSN.
