summary: I'm searching for plugins created using JetBrains OpenAPI for ReSharper 2.0+,
  but they're proving difficult to find.  The only one I've encountered is mentioned
  in a blog post, and it doesn't seem to have been officially released.  I have some
  plugin ideas of my own, but the available documentation and examples aren't very
  helpful.
