summary: A List Apart, a popular website found via Technorati, uses Ruby on Rails.  I'm
  curious about Ruby on Rails and its benefits for web development.  The site's neutral
  color scheme and articles are visually appealing, possibly utilizing color theory.

I was just searching on Technorati, and one of the Top Searches was for <a href="http://www.alistapart.org">http://www.alistapart.org</a><p />They are using Ruby on Rails, I am not too sure what that is but it seems to be something based around the language Ruby. Why is Ruby good for developing Websites?<p />What is special about Ruby?<p />I have to admit it, their site looks pretty darn cool.  I like the colour scheme, it is quite neutral.  I like their <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/">articles</a> too!<p />I wonder if they used <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/colour-theory.html">Colour Theory</a>? :)<p />
