Following my post about a lack of <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/10/re-bluetooth-library.html" title="Post about lack of bluetooth libraries">bluetooth communications</a> libraries for desktop style pc's.  <a href="http://blog.markarteaga.com/" title="Mark Arteaga's Blog">Mark Arteaga</a> has pointed me towards <a href="http://32feet.net/default.aspx" title="Managed Bluetooth Library">32Feet.net</a>, which has a managed library.  I have not had a chance to look at it just yet, but when I do I will let you know what it is like.<p />From the sample it looks pretty simple to use.  Discovering devices looks like it can return an array of bluetooth accessbile systems via: BluetoothDeviceInfo[] bdi = bc.DiscoverDevices(12); (not too sure what 12 means, but it might be the maximum number of devices).  All the communication appears to be stream based.<p />
