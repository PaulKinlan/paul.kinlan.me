[Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/) is one of the more visible
projects that I have worked on. 

The premise was simple, in a world that is 'Going Mobile' there was no resource
on the web that concerntrated on best practices of the migration from a desktop
focused web to a multi-device focused web.

In 2014, Google noticed that search was moving quickly to mobile, yet the web
wasn't particularly mobile friendly. Google found that users who landed on
corretly formatted sites that were optimized for the device, and they had
decided that on Mobile they would badge mobile optimized sites before a
transition to potential ranking changes preferring mobile optimized sites.

Web Fundamentals was the resource that we launched alongside the plan to badge
mobile friendly sites in mobile search. We started with a team of about 4 people
(and a web development agency to build the first versio of the site) and
sprinted to a launch in about 7-8 weeks.

Since then, Web Fundamentals has become the center of our developer relations
narratives. It's the place where we try to guide developers on what is happening
on the web platform &mdash; we merged [html5rocks](/projects/html5rocks/)
updates in to [/web/updates](https://developers.google.com/web/updates). Our
[tools for improving developer
productivity](https://developers.google.com/web/tools) are centralized here.
Finally our guidance for [`Progressive Web
Apps`](https://developers.google.com/web/pwa) is here.

I'm very proud of this project and how the team have centralised around a common
narrative for developers, and I'm pleased to see the traffic and engagement that
we get with developers on the site.
