The [Claude Breadboard Kit](https://github.com/PaulKinlan/claude-breadboard-kit "https://github.com/PaulKinlan/claude-breadboard-kit") is a simple plugin that enables you to build Breadboards that interface directly with Claude.

It offers just one node: `generateCompletion`.

You can integrate it into your breadboard runtime by adding it as a kit using `addRuntimeKit(Claude)` and then reference the `generateCompletion` node.
