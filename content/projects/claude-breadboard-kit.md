description: Claude Breadboard Kit - a simple way to interface with the Claude API
slug: claude-breadboard-kit
summary: I've created the Claude Breadboard Kit, a simple plugin to easily connect
  your Breadboards with the Claude API.  It features a single `generateCompletion`
  node for streamlined integration. Add it to your breadboard runtime using `addRuntimeKit(Claude)`
  and start using the  `generateCompletion` node.

The [Claude Breadboard Kit](https://github.com/PaulKinlan/claude-breadboard-kit "https://github.com/PaulKinlan/claude-breadboard-kit") is a simple plugin that enables you to build Breadboards that interface directly with Claude.

It offers just one node: `generateCompletion`.

You can integrate it into your breadboard runtime by adding it as a kit using `addRuntimeKit(Claude)` and then reference the `generateCompletion` node.
