description: An aggregation of our GDE's content
slug: gdedeck
summary: I'm incredibly proud of the Web GDE program, a global community of top-tier
  web developers who are dedicated to building amazing web experiences and supporting
  the wider community.  To help keep track of all the great content these experts
  create, I built GDE Deck, a TweetDeck-style aggregator.  In developing GDE Deck,
  it evolved into a hosted service called Topic Deck.

One of the projects that I am most proud of is that with Robert Nyman we've
managed to create and build up a program called 'Web GDE' or 'Web Google
Developer Experts'. The GDE program is a collection of *some* of the worlds
leading web developers who are out in the community building software and
supporting the wider community to improve the quality of web experiences.

We meet regularly, but I've found it hard to keep on top of all the great
content that our GDE's create, so I wanted to solve that by building
a TweetDeck like tool called the GDE Deck.

As I built out The [GDE Deck](https://gdedeck.com/) it morphed in to a hosted
service called [Topic Deck](/projects/topicdeck).
