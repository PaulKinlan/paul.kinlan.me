title: Email Summary Service
description: A simple tool that summarizes the email that is sent to it.

I get a lot of newsletters, and I love them. They often contain a wealth of deep insight that I can\'t easily find while browsing the web. Yes, there are RSS feeds that publish their protected content, but since I spend so much time in my email, I effectively use it as a way of browsing.

I really wanted a way to get quick summaries of the newsletters I read, so I built one. [Val.town](http://Val.town "http://Val.town") is an amazing platform; you can quickly create an HTTP endpoint, a cron job, or an email handler and publish it to the web in milliseconds.

Send an email to [paulkinlan.emailSummaryHandler@valtown.email](mailto:paulkinlan.emailSummaryHandler@valtown.email "mailto:paulkinlan.emailSummaryHandler@valtown.email"), and in a couple of seconds, you\'ll get back a summary of its contents.

Given the asynchronous, text-based nature of email, I\'m surprised there haven\'t been more tools built that interact with it using LLMs.
