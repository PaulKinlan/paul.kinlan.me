description: A simple web app that helps you with Crosswords and Codewords
slug: wordhelper.app
summary: During lockdown, my partner and I got into crosswords and codewords.  Since
  English isn't my partner's first language and I wasn't great at English in school,
  I created a simple web app (wordhelper.app) to help us find potential solutions.  I
  wanted something quick, easy to use, and without annoying ads, so I built my own.  Just
  enter the letters you know, use underscores or periods for unknown letters (e.g.,
  CA___A), and use digits for repeating unknown letters (e.g., B12121).  A technical
  write-up on this PWA is coming soon!

During the lockdown me and my partner got into crosswords and codewords, and with my 
partners first language not being English, and me mostly failing English in school I built
[this little web app](https://wordhelper.app/) to help us find potential solutions for 
crosswords.

I built this simple app because 1) I didn't want to install an app, and 2) a lot of the 
sites on the Web are laden with junk adverts or complex syntax. I just wanted something simple
to use and that loaded instantly.

To use the app, you just include all the letters you know and use _ or . for the letters
that you don't know (i.e, [CA___A](https://wordhelper.app/find/CA___A)). If you know there 
are two letters that will be the same but you don't know what they are you can use a 
digit (i.e, [B12121](https://wordhelper.app/find/B12121)).

I will do a technical write up soon, but it's a pretty traditional PWA.
