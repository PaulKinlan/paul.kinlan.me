title: Update To AJAX Tagger Version 2 [New Domain]

---
I have made a new subdomain for the AJAX Tagger. It just makes it a little bit easier to type. I also have a new domain name for it, but I need to make sure that the application is working before I put it on there.<p />The AJAX Tagger can still be found in the old location (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2</a>), but now it can also be found at <a href="http://ajaxtag.kinlan.co.uk">http://ajaxtag.kinlan.co.uk</a>.<p />Both versions will continue to be updated.<p />
