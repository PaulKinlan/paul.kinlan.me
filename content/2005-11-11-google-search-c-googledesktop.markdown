summary: This post discusses a reader's search query related to C# and Google Desktop.  While
  I haven't personally worked with Google Desktop plugins, I found a relevant article
  in the November 2005 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal.  The article, \"Improving Search
  Precision Using Google Desktop Search 1.0,\" details how to use C# to search the
  Citeseer database with Google Desktop, including updates for version 2.0.  The article
  is available on www.ddj.com, but may require a subscription.

One of the visitors to my site did a search for "c# googledesktop". Whilst I have never done any plugin programming for the Google Desktop, there is an article that exists called "Improving Search Precision Using Goolgle Desktop Search 1.0" this article was in the November 2005 Doctor Dobb's Journal.<p />It covers a C# implemenation for searching the Citeseer database with some extra information using Google Desktop. It is a nice article to read and it even mentions some of the changes required to get it working in Google Desktop 2.0.<p /><a href="http://www.ddj.com">www.ddj.com</a> is the website, not too sure you can access the article unless you are a subscriber though.<p />
