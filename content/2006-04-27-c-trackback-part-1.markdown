summary: In this first part of my series on C# Trackback implementation, I delve into
  the Trackback Ping functionality, providing a comprehensive code explanation.  While
  I remain unconvinced about the overall effectiveness of Trackbacks, exploring the
  implementation in C# has been an interesting coding exercise.
