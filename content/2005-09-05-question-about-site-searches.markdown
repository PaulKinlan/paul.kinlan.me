summary: I'm having a hard time finding content on my own website, so I'm looking
  for a good site search engine.  I'm considering Google Site Search for potential
  ad revenue but don't think that is important. Any recommendations for good, free
  site search software?  Email me at paul.kinlan@gmail.com or leave a comment if you

title: Question About Site Searches

---
I am starting to have trouble finding things on my site and am in need of a search engine for the contents.  I was thinking of going with Googles site search because I might be able to get Advert Revenue, but I don't think that it is really an issue.<p />Does anyone know any good, free site searching software.  If you do drop me an email: <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a> or leave a comment.<p />
