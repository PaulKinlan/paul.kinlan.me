title: Question About Site Searches
published: true
---
I am starting to have trouble finding things on my site and am in need of a search engine for the contents.  I was thinking of going with Googles site search because I might be able to get Advert Revenue, but I don't think that it is really an issue.<p />Does anyone know any good, free site searching software.  If you do drop me an email: <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a> or leave a comment.<p />
