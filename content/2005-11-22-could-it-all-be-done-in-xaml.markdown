summary: Inspired by my recent success binding XAML directly to Amazon's web service,
  I'm exploring the possibility of extending this approach to other RESTful services.  Imagine
  building applications, like my AJAX Tagger, entirely in XAML, without any C# code.  This
  hinges on WPF's capabilities. Do you think it's feasible?

title: Could it all be done in XAML

After having a little success with my example with XAML binding directly into Amazons webservice I am thinking that I might be able to automatically bind directly to other services that expose a REST interface.  And if I can do that with very little code I might be able to make my AJAX Tagger completly in XAML without a hint of C#.  I hope the WPF [Windows Presentation Foundation] will let me do that.<p />What do you reckon, do you think it can be done?<p />
