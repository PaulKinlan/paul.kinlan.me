After having a little success with my example with XAML binding directly into Amazons webservice I am thinking that I might be able to automatically bind directly to other services that expose a REST interface.  And if I can do that with very little code I might be able to make my AJAX Tagger completly in XAML without a hint of C#.  I hope the WPF [Windows Presentation Foundation] will let me do that.<p />What do you reckon, do you think it can be done?<p />
