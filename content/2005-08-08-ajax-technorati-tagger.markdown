My First AJAX Application is now up (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag.html">here</a>).<p />Some thanks must go out to Bill Bercik whos <a href="http://www.webpasties.com/xmlHttpRequest/">sample AJAX application</a> I looked at and used a smidging of code from (The AJAX object factory).<p />The way to use the application is to as follows:<br /><ul>
<li>Enter some text into the first page.  This text has to be more that a couple of words.</li>
<li>Click "Submit", this will call the yahoo web service and present the user with a list of "potential" tags for technorati. (There will be a hook in to technorati here at some point in the future).</li>
<li>Select the tags you wish to use and click next (this next step might take a while).</li>
<li>When on the next page it will give the user a list of related keywords (again from Yahoo!), [NOTE: Selecting the search results is not nesecarry because it doesn"t do anything just yet].</li>
<li>Click "Finish", to generate the link list that looks similar to mine at the bottom of this blog entry.</li>
</ul><br />Anyway all comments, hate mail etc is accepted :)<p />ps.  There are a lot of Bugs to be ironed out. :)<p />
