summary: I've updated my AJAX application, DeliTag (The Delicious Tag Poster)! Now,
  when you select text within the IFRAME, the application will analyze only the selected
  text instead of the entire page. This makes tagging much more precise.

- ajax
- javascript
- delicious

Further update to my AJAX Application [DeliTag](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/DeliTag) (The Delicious Tag Poster), if you select the text in the IFRAME then the software will only analyse the selected text rather than the whole page.<p />
