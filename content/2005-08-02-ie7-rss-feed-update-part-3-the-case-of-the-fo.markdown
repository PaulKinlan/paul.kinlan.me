summary: IE7 finds the RSS feed on channel9.msdn.com but doesn't display it correctly,
  only showing the raw XML.  I'm looking for other examples of feeds that IE7 can't
  render properly to compile a list and see if there's a pattern or bug.  If you know
  of any, please email me!

  [Is it a Bug]'

I was pretty sure that there are some feeds that get found by IE7 yet don't display correctly if at all in the "Feed View".  If you direct Internet Explorer 7 towards channel9.msdn.com, you should see that it detects a feed is available, now if you try and view the feed all it shows is the XML.<p />Why doesn't it XSLT the feed correctly.  I don't know?  But if you do, let me know.  I am thinking of starting a list of feeds that do not appear to render correctly, it might be a bug, it might not.  But if anyone from Microsoft stumbles accross this site it might help them.<p />If anyone who reads this blog [I know there are at least three people now :)] knows any feeds that don't render drop me an email [<a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a>]<p />
