summary: The pace of change in web development, particularly with APIs and browser
  updates, is overwhelming.  The constant deprecation and breaking changes cause friction
  and highlight a lack of empathy for developers struggling to keep up.  While frequent
  updates are important, the current model, exemplified by Chrome, feels too aggressive.  This
  blog post will explore this tension, examining whether we've pushed developers too
  far, and discuss strategies for a more sustainable pace of change.  It will also
  touch on platform-specific resources like web.dev and the challenge of balancing
  innovation with support for the broader developer community.

title: Developer Clarity

---

* Drip feed of API's
* Deprecate and Break. Recent events were a stark reminder that empathy is key. 
* Time for a change.
  * On one hand people don't like Apple's model of ship twice a year with an OS update, on the other Chrome is pushing too quickly. Alex Komoroske talked about elastic band and tension and stretch too far it snaps.
    * Have we reached that points
  * web.dev - appears Chrome only.
    * too much change.
    * too quickly.
  * Refernce - too fast, can't keep up.  Other's shouldn't have to work because of our lack of support.
  * How can we slow down, but keep pace? Maybe batch more. The general population of developers don't need to know about all new API's on the day they launch.
