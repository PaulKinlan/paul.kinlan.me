summary: 'I''ve created a basic JavaScript Object Model for OPML, which you can find
  here: [http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/opml.js](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/opml.js).  It''s
  not entirely finished yet, but the core structure is in place. I plan to write proper
  documentation soon.'

The JavaScript file can be found [here](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/opml.js).  It is not fully complete, but a basic object model is up.  I will try and document it later.<p />
