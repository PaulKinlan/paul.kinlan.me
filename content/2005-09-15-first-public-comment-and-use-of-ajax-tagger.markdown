I just recieved a nice email from <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/Factuurexpress?p=2011">Gaby de Wilde</a>, this is the first person who I don't know directly who has used my <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">AJAX</a> Tagger.  He even gave me a link on his site.  <p />Thanks!!  I have taken the feedback and will add some of your suggestions to my requirements for the next version.<p />Anyway, take a trip over to his blog to see my tags in action.<p />If anyone has any suggestions I would greatly appreciate feedback.<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
