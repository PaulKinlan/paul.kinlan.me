summary: 'I''ve created a tool called DeliTag that automatically suggests tags for
  any page on kinlan.co.uk and submits them to your Delicious account.  It''s a quick
  process: hit \"Goto\", let the page load, click \"Analyze\" to see tag suggestions,
  choose the ones you like, enter your Delicious credentials, and press \"Submit\".  Keep
  in mind, this currently only works on my site and requires IE6+ with Cross Domain
  Data Island support. Passwords are sent as plain text, mimicking Delicious''s own
  method. Let me know if you''d like to see this developed further!'

title: 1 hour later and I have made the Delicious Automatic Tagger

---
I am quite pleased with myself.  After 1 hour and using the Framework I have been creating for a while for the AJAX Tagger I have created a piece of software that will automatically post to [Delicious](http://del.icio.us) the tags that are related to any page on <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk" title="www.kinlan.co.uk">www.kinlan.co.uk</a>.<p />It only works on Kinlan.co.uk, but it you have a [Delicious](http://del.icio.us) Account please try this and let me know if I should develop it futher.<p />Here are the instructions, Press "Goto", When the page has loaded press "Analyze".  Once the Tags Come Back, select the ones you want and type in your [Delicious](http://del.icio.us) username and password and then press "Submit".<p />The passwords are sent plain text, but this is the way Delicious does it and I don't process them because I call [Delicious](http://del.icio.us) straight away.<p />IE6+ is needed and so is The Cross Domain Data Island support.<p />It works for anypage on my site.  I will endeavour to get some support for sites outside my domain.<p /><a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/DeliTag" title="DeliTag">DeliTag</a><p />
