Happy new year!

I thought I would note down some of the things that I am excited about for the
web and that I hope to be writing a bit more about over the coming weeks and
months. This is just a super quick list and isn't based on any sort of priority.

* Web Assembly
  * All browsers shipping within the year. It opens up a lot of interesting 
    possibilities on the web, especially with bringing more native libraries
    to the web ([FFMPEG for example](https://paul.kinlan.me/ffmpeg-ideas/))
* Web Components
  * Majority of browsers shipping all the required requisite components (Shadow
    DOM, Templates, Custom Elements)
* A less [lumpy web](/the-lumpy-web/) with more consistency across browsers to
  help reduce developer pain and frustration.
* [Meta platforms](https://paul.kinlan.me/rise-of-the-meta-platforms/) become a
  more known entity and as an industry we have parts of a plan on how to build
  for them.
* Browser vendors are doing even more developer outreach - I am looking forward
  to the non-western browser vendors doing even more in this space.
* Progressive enhancement and Accessibility seem to have been gaining ground a
  little more (although Google Trends suggests otherwise). I am excited to see
  this trend continue and become more important for users and developers.
* A more consistent and prescriptive Media story across platforms
  * How to encode video and audio effectively
  * How to build a next gen media player site
  * How the future of media on the web will work.
* Enhanced Media APIs come to the platform
  * getUserMedia everywhere and WebRTC everywhere
  * Media Session API
  * Web VR - more experiments and exploring where it can go
  * Image Capture API and advanced APIs
* Even more CSS primitives &mdash; CSS Grid is ever so close!
* This is the year that [everyone migrates from
  Flash](https://paul.kinlan.me/whither-flash/).
* Headless Chrome lands letting us run more of the [browser on the
  server](https://paul.kinlan.me/running-chrome-on-appengine/) and building
  [interesting services on top of that](https://paul.kinlan.me/chrome-on-home/).
  It will start off with more web hosted developer tools and then in to more
  services once people realise how easy it is.
* [Headless Web](/the-headless-web) becomes even more of a thing.
* Smooth payment, sign-up and sign-in services across the web ([HT Peter Gasston
  for reminding me](https://twitter.com/stopsatgreen/status/816221752762269696))
* Increased Service Worker adoption
  * More robust sites that work instantly on first load and work all the times
    even when offline.
  * Better Push Notification integrations
  * Better large download support
* Tighter integration with the host platform when developers and users want it.
  * Generic Sensor API giving us more consistent access to sensors on the users
    device
  * Great apps that use BLE and more adoption of that API
  * Fully installable Web Apps
  * [Sharing API allowing me to share to native apps](https://paul.kinlan.me/navigator.share/)
  * Share receiver API allowing my web app to be shared to from native apps
* [Really hitting home](/slice-the-web/) the benefits of the web to people,
  businesses and developers.
* SSL Everywhere (and more) with businesses and developers prioritizing security.
* A focus on strong UX on the web and Performance and the industry prioritizing
  this.
* The web reaching more people as they come online with Mobile. There is still
  a huge amount of potential and growth in India, Indonesia, China, Thailand,
  Vietnam, all of Africa. You name it, mobile is growing massively still and
  the web is accessible on all of these devices.

I am incredibly excited for 2017 and I am going to keep updating this post. 
What are you excited about with the web?
