title: Developer Toolbar for IE announced at PDC
published: true
---
There is now a developer toolbar made by Microsoft for Internet Explorer both IE7 and IE6.  Just installing it throws up lots of warnings in the Microsoft Anti Spyware tool, and it requires a restart of the Computer!!! Why does it need to do that! [I found that it works without a restart]<p />Anyway I am about to start playing with it.  I will let you know what it is like.<p />Here is the article taken from the blog entry.<br /><blockquote>
<p>The developer community has asked for a long time: Where is the free developer toolbar for IE? We recognized the popularity of free IE tools like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwebgen/html/IE_IntroFiddler.asp">Fiddler</a> and we listened to your feedback. I am glad to announce the next addition to our developer tool support: The IE dev toolbar. This tool will help developers to explore their HTML documents and understand everything about it. </p>
<br /><p>With the IE Dev Toolbar you have several features at your fingertips to go deep into existing pages or pages that you are currently creating. You will be able to explore the DOM tree and find elements on the page, disable IE settings, view information, outline elements, control images, resize pages to common screen resolutions and have a powerful ruler that lets you measure pixel perfect content on your page. It also will help you to validate against existing standards and provides pointers to W3C specs. </p>
<br /><p>At Chris's talk at the PDC on Tuesday, he announced that we would have a beta version available very soon. This is now <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&amp;displaylang=en">ready and available for download</a>. It is designed to work on IE6 as well as IE7. </p>
<br /><p>I would like to thank our interns, Carl LeCompte, Mary Ann Jawili, Barbara Morales, Seth McLaughlin and Jeffrey Varga for doing a great job working on this project, and also a big thanks to David McKinnis, our developer.</p>
<br /><p>I would love to hear in the comment section what you think and what additional features you would like to see added. Bugs can be reported at the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/wiki/default.aspx/Channel9.InternetExplorerDevToolbar">Channel9 wiki</a>. </p>
