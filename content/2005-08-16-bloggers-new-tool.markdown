Blogger have released a new product.  Just when I filled in the survey saying there weren't developing enough cool new stuff to keep me interested they come out with this:<br /><a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/bloggerforword.html">Word Blogger</a>, which I think I will call Worger! :)<p />This is a plugin for Microsoft Word that lets you post a Word document direct to your blog.  I can't wait to have a go, it looks interesting.  Does anyone have any reviews of it yet?  Does it keep the exact format of your Word document?<p />This is actually quite a timely software release, I was getting really annoyed with the WSIWYG editor that I had gone back to plain mode.  Why the WSYWIG editor can't do lists, paragraphs and blockelements correctly is beyond me. (it does tag links and email addresses nicely though!)<p />Anyway, I will give it a try and post my feed back on my blog.<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
