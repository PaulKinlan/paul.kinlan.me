summary: 'My tag directory has a cool new feature: Amazon product integration! It
  pulls book data from Amazon AWS related to each tag.  Right now, it adds links to
  relevant products, but I''m thinking of adding images soon. This latest addition
  brings the total number of Web 2.0 APIs used in my mashup to four, including Delicious,
  Yahoo Search API, and Google Blog Search RSS. Check out the examples for tags like
  RDF, RSS, and Mashup to see it in action.'
