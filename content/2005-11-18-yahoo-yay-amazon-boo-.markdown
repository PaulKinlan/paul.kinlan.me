summary: I'm consistently impressed by Yahoo's web service team and their responsiveness
  to users.  In contrast, Amazon's web service support is practically non-existent.  My
  simple question about UK support for the TextStream parameter in AWS has gone unanswered
  for ages, and I know I'm not alone.  Amazon, please step up your game!

I know I harp on about Yahoo's webservice team being amazing and responding to the requests of their users in a timely manner.  Well you contrast this with Amazons Webservice support which is next to none existant.  It appears to me that there hardly ever any Amazon support guys on the forums!<p />I asked a question ages ago, quite a simple one and it never got answered.  I know there are lots of people in the same boat as me too.  Amazon, come on!  Pull your act together.<p /><strong>All I wanted to know is if there are any plans to support the TextStream parameter in the UK version of the AWS?</strong><p />Does anybody out there know?<p />
