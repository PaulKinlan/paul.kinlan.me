summary: 'I''m excited about Technorati''s new REST API for blog post tags! It lets
  developers display all the tags used on a site, which is super helpful.  I''ve even
  created a simple tool using the API to show all the tags I''ve used on my site:
  http://www.kinlan.co.uk/cgi-bin/SiteInfo.pl.  The API is easy to use and provides
  useful stats.  I''m already thinking about how to incorporate it into my next project.  Great
  work, Technorati!'

title: Cool Technorati API Update

---
This is just a quick entry, Technorati have come up with a Cool REST API. <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/BlogPostTags">http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/BlogPostTags</a><p />The API, lets a developer display all the tags that a particular site has created.  It is pretty cool because it lets me see that some of the issues I have been having have been resolved.<p />Check out <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/cgi-bin/SiteInfo.pl">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/cgi-bin/SiteInfo.pl</a> if you want to see all the tags I have used.  It is a really simple API to use, and includes some basic stats about the tag (the number of times they been used).  I can see how I can use this already in my next application, I am made up.<p />It is simple little API's like this that I like!  Keep up the good work Technorati!<p />
