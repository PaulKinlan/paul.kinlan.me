This is just a quick entry, Technorati have come up with a Cool REST API. <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/BlogPostTags">http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/BlogPostTags</a><p />The API, lets a developer display all the tags that a particular site has created.  It is pretty cool because it lets me see that some of the issues I have been having have been resolved.<p />Check out <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/cgi-bin/SiteInfo.pl">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/cgi-bin/SiteInfo.pl</a> if you want to see all the tags I have used.  It is a really simple API to use, and includes some basic stats about the tag (the number of times they been used).  I can see how I can use this already in my next application, I am made up.<p />It is simple little API's like this that I like!  Keep up the good work Technorati!<p />
