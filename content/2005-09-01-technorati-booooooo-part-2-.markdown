I would like to add a quick note.  The problem I had with their support, may or may not have been rectified.  I can see some results that I have been looking for, my main problem is the fact that I didn't recieve a response from the Technorati Support.<p />A quick email saying:"Your site was black listed" or, "yeah we had a problem", or "your site was down when we tried to index it so it was taken off our lists"; would have sufficed.<p />Anyway,  I still love you Technorati :)<p />
