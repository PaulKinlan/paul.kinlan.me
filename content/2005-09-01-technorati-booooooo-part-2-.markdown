summary: In this follow-up post, I want to clarify the issue I had with Technorati.
  While some of the search results I was looking for are now appearing, my main concern
  remains the lack of communication from Technorati Support. A simple email explaining
  the situation, such as a blacklisting, a temporary problem, or an indexing issue
  due to site downtime, would have been sufficient. Despite this, I still appreciate
  Technorati.

I would like to add a quick note.  The problem I had with their support, may or may not have been rectified.  I can see some results that I have been looking for, my main problem is the fact that I didn't recieve a response from the Technorati Support.<p />A quick email saying:"Your site was black listed" or, "yeah we had a problem", or "your site was down when we tried to index it so it was taken off our lists"; would have sufficed.<p />Anyway,  I still love you Technorati :)<p />
