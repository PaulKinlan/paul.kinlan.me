Oddly I rarely talk about Developer Relations, but I feel like changing that today.

I feel really uncomfortable when I hear people suggest Hackathons are a part of building a sustainable, scalable developer ecosystem.  

**They are not.**

I have run hackathons.  Some better than others.  I have learnt a lot about them.

Businesses and Platform creators:

*  If you are thinking of running a hackathon to win potential new customers **you are doing it wrong**.
*  If you are wanting someone to start a business by using your platform at your hackathon **you are doing it wrong**.
*  If you are running hackathons to raise brand awareness **you are doing it wrong**.
*  If you are offering winners $SOMERANDOMLARGENUMBER **you are doing it wrong**.
*  If your product team (PMs through to Eng) are not at the hackathon **you are doing it wrong**.

Hackathons can be a thing of beauty, they can produce completely unexpected demos, but that is not your goal. You should be using it as a learning exercise for **you**, **your team** and **fixing your product**.  It is the developer version of a beta test, not a marketing tool.

Learn from the developers using your platform.  Ask yourselves the following questions:

*  Do your demos work? are developers using the demos to build on top of them?
*  Does your documentation work? can developers start by diving into the docs and following the guides step by step?
*  Does your platform work?  Is your API intuitive?  Are developers getting stuck on certain parts?
*  Is there value to your platform?  Is it possible for people to build sustainable integrations on your platform?

You can answer all these questions at a Hackathon.  That is what you should be concentrating on.

One little point, rather than just rewarding teams who produce a lot, reward filing bugs and issues on all parts of your product, the apis, the documentation, the demos and the value as well.
