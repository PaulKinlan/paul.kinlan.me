summary: akachan.app is a Single Page Application (SPA) built for instant loading
  without using JavaScript on the client-side.  Instead, all JavaScript resides in
  a Service Worker and is also executable on the server. This approach offers significant
  performance benefits but introduces challenges regarding third-party sign-in integration
  and data synchronization.
