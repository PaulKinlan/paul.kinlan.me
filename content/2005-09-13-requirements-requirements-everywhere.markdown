I am starting to document things a little more at the moment.  It is a slow process, I keep getting distracted by all the cool stuff I am missing that PDC.  Most of my slowness it is revolving around MSN opening up there search to a public API.  I don't really know whether it is worth me doing anything with it,  it is a soap API and doesn't seem to offer anything that I can't already pull from their RSS Searching and RSS results.  I will think a little more and I might see if I can offer some services in my next AJAX Appication (AJAXTagger v2), however I have to be really sure that I don't get bogged down by feature creep.<p />I have some resources all in one place on my main blog.  <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/msn-search-apis-are-up.html" title="MSN Search API's"><br />http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/msn-search-apis-are-up.html</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcoms-developer-centre.html" title="Start.coms Developer Program">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcoms-developer-centre.html<br /></a><p />
