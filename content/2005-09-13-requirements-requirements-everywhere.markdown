summary: I'm trying to be more diligent about documentation, but PDC distractions
  and the new MSN Search API have me sidetracked.  The API's SOAP format and seeming
  redundancy with existing RSS search options make me question its value.  Maybe I'll
  integrate it into AJAXTagger v2 if I can avoid feature creep.  Check out my blog
  for MSN Search and Start.com developer program resources.

I am starting to document things a little more at the moment.  It is a slow process, I keep getting distracted by all the cool stuff I am missing that PDC.  Most of my slowness it is revolving around MSN opening up there search to a public API.  I don't really know whether it is worth me doing anything with it,  it is a soap API and doesn't seem to offer anything that I can't already pull from their RSS Searching and RSS results.  I will think a little more and I might see if I can offer some services in my next AJAX Appication (AJAXTagger v2), however I have to be really sure that I don't get bogged down by feature creep.<p />I have some resources all in one place on my main blog.  <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/msn-search-apis-are-up.html" title="MSN Search API's">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/msn-search-apis-are-up.html</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcoms-developer-centre.html" title="Start.coms Developer Program">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcoms-developer-centre.html</a><p />
