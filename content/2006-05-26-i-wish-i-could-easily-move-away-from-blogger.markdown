No significant updates to functionality, incosistent abilty to publish pages, little flexibilty.  I really wouldn't recommend blogger.com to anyone.<img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-114867984672737631?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" />
