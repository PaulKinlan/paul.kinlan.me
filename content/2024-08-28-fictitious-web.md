I saw [https://websim.ai](https://websim.ai "https://websim.ai") a couple of weeks ago but didn\'t quite get it, and then during some research on the creator and web developer ecosystems I came back to it and my mind was blown.

I spent the evening exploring a web that is full of applications and sites and only limited by URLs that I could think of (heh - this web never has a 404 or an unregistered domain). It\'s a web that doesn\'t actually exist.I obviously went to [my site first](https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/paul-kinlan-s-blog "https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/paul-kinlan-s-blog") (note - I re-did this when I published it).

I then created a clone of [everytimezone](https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/paul-kinlan-s-blog "https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/paul-kinlan-s-blog") (I needed to arrange a meeting in the NYC and Mountain View)

And then I built an interactive globe showing population of *some* major cities

And then I wanted to see if I could create a [simple site for a trip to Toya in Hokkaido](https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/discover-toya-a-cultural-journey-in-hokkaido "https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/discover-toya-a-cultural-journey-in-hokkaido")

My wife and I created a site that showcases the beauty of North Wales to a Japanese audience (we didn\'t publish it)... and I just explored and explored.

The entire evening reminded me of when I first discovered blogging and would just go from site to site, reading and playing with the things people built.

I really do encourage everyone to try and play with [https://websim.ai](https://websim.ai "https://websim.ai") even if it takes a little while to get the hang of the [UI for generating sites](https://websim.ai/@katwinter/websim-ui-guide "https://websim.ai/@katwinter/websim-ui-guide").
