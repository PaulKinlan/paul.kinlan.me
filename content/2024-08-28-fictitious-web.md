summary: Experimented with WebSim, a simulated web environment, creating sites like
  a personal blog, timezone converter, interactive globe, and a travel site. The experience
  was reminiscent of the early web's playful exploration and highlighted WebSim's
  potential for creativity and interactive experiences.

title: I spent an evening on a fictitious web

---

I saw [https://websim.ai](https://websim.ai) a couple of weeks ago but didn\'t quite get it, and then during some research on the creator and web developer ecosystems I came back to it and my mind was blown.

I spent the evening exploring a web that is full of applications and sites and only limited by URLs that I could think of (heh - this web never has a 404 or an unregistered domain). WebSim provides a simulation of the web via a faux Web Browser. It\'s a web that doesn\'t actually exist, but one that works incredibly well. I obviously went to [my site first](https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/paul-kinlan-s-blog) (note - I re-did this when I published it).

I then created a clone of [everytimezone](https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/everytimezone-com) (I needed to arrange a meeting in the NYC and Mountain View)

And then I built an interactive globe showing population of *some* major cities

And then I wanted to see if I could create a [simple site for a trip to Toya in Hokkaido](https://websim.ai/@paul_kinlan/discover-toya-a-cultural-journey-in-hokkaido)

My wife and I created a site that showcases the beauty of North Wales to a Japanese audience (we didn\'t publish it)... and I just explored and explored. I played with simple games, interactive experiences, I even got on a plane.... It's like the Web's Roblox.

The entire evening reminded me of when I first discovered blogging and would just go from site to site, reading and playing with the things people built and just having a lot of fun. On one hand this was demonstrates an entire virtual world that I just got lost for hours in this new virtual world, on the other the fact that entire sites and functioning games and apps work is just mind blowing.

I really do encourage everyone to try and play with [https://websim.ai](https://websim.ai) even if it takes a little while to get the hang of the [UI for generating sites](https://websim.ai/@katwinter/websim-ui-guide).
