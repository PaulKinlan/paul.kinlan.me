title: Looking for some people to help test new features of Topicala
published: true
---
I am looking for people who have small blogs to help me test some new features on <a href="http://www.topicala.com/">http://www.topicala.com/</a>.<p />The software that I am creating is similar to <a href="http://digg.com/">http://digg.com/</a>, but different. :) And is intended to help the "little guy" (you and me) get more people visiting our sites.<p />The new features aren't complete yet, but a basic page has been created and I am working on it daily.<p />So if you are interested, please email me at <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a>, or leave a comment and I will get back to you straight away. I will be also contacting people whose blogs I read to see if they are interested helping the project.<p />Topicala Tags: <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/Digg">Digg</a>, <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/Topicala" rel="tag">Topicala</a>, <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/Beta" rel="tag">Beta</a>, <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/Bloggers" rel="tag">Bloggers</a>
