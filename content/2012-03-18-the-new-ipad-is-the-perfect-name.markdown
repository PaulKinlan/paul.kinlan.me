<p>I was thinking about this the other day. I remember being in the Apple store in Liverpool about 2 months ago and I distinctly remember hearing the following: &quot;Do you have any of the new iPads in?&quot; several times over the space of about 30 minutes (I was playing with MacBook Airs).</p> <p>Come to think of it there were several other products people asked for as &quot;the new X&quot;.</p> <p>It is pretty cool. No product name obsolescence. You go in to a store you ask for the new product, they give it to you.</p> <p>You either have the new one or the old one.</p> <p>I predict the iPad series will only ever now be known as iPad and The New iPad. I also believe they will do it for more products the next being The New iPhone.</p>
