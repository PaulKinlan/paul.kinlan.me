summary: I've given my tag directory a fresh look and made it faster with some caching!
  Check it out and tell me what you think.  I'm considering integrating del.icio.us
  and Amazon product links, and I'd also like to auto-generate OPML feeds for each
  tag.  Your feedback is much appreciated!

title: Tag Directory Styled and also implements some caching

---
I have just updated my my tag directory [try <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/anytag">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/anytag</a> - replacing anytag with the tag you want to look for].  I have updated the styles and also implemented some caching so that subsequent requests will be quick!<p />Have a play and let me know what you think.<p />Let me know what you would like to see here.
