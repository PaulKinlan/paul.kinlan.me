I have just updated my my tag directory [try <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/anytag">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/anytag</a> - replacing anytag with the tag you want to look for].  I have updated the styles and also implemented some caching so that subsequent requests will be quick!<p />Have a play and let me know what you think.<p />Let me know what you would like to see here.  I am thinking of integrating del.icio.us and Amazon products.  Additionally I would like to auto generate some OPML feeds for each tag!<p />
