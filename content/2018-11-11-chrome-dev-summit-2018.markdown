I am so excited! Tomorrow is the 6th Chrome Dev Summit and it's all coming together.

> Join us at the 6th Chrome Dev Summit to engage with Chrome engineers and leading web developers for a two-day exploration of modern web experiences.
> 
> We'll be diving deep into what it means to build a fast, high quality web experience using modern web technologies and best practices, as well as looking at the new and exciting capabilities coming to the web platform.

I'm currently in the rehearsals and the tech check on the day before the event and it's looking pretty good :) the talks are done, the MC's are MC'ing, and the jokes are terrible :)

We've split the event into two distinct groups: Web of Today (Day 1); and thoughts on the Web of Tomorrow (Day 2).

The thinking I had behind this was that we want web developers to come away with a clear understanding of the what we (Chrome and Google) think is a good snapshot of modern web development and what we think the most important focuses businesses and developers should focus on for their users - Speed, UI, and Capability; and most importantly how to meet those objectives based on our learnings from working with a lot of developers over the last year.

The second day focus is interesting and it's something new that we are trying this year. The intent of the day is to be a lot clearer about what we are starting to work on over the year ahead and where we need your feedback and help to make sure that we are building things that developers need - there should be a lot of deep dives in to new technologies that are being designed to fix common problems we all have building modern web experiences and a lot of opportunity to give our teams feedback so that we can help build a better web with the ecosystem.

I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone over the next two days.
