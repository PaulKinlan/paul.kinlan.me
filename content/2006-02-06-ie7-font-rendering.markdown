title: IE7 Font Rendering

I have been playing around a bit with Internet Explorer 7 Beta 2 and one of the first things that I noticed about it [other than the new UI] is that the fonts seem to render with ClearType.  It was a bit of a shock because it was really subtle at first but now I really notice the difference.  If you have IE7 Beta1 and goto <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk">http://news.bbc.co.uk</a> and then try it with Beta2 you will see exactly what I mean.<p />Sweet.<p />I also found a link on the IE Blog about what has changed [<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/02/03/524367.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/02/03/524367.aspx</a>].<p />
