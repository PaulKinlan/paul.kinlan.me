summary: Liverpool John Lennon Airport is in a terrible state! There are not enough
  chairs, the restaurants are dirty, and it's unbearably hot. I'd rather fly from
  Manchester or Heathrow than deal with this again.

Currently stuck in Liverpool John Lennon airport. For all the investment that has gone into this place I cannot believe the state it is in. <p /> There are not enough chairs in the departure lounges, so when all the planes are delayed (thank you easyjet) everyone has to either sit on the dirty floor or lie against windows or stand for hours at a time. <p /> The restaurants don't clean up anywhere near enough. The place is grubby. <p /> Finally, the place is so hot, with no sense of air conditioning it is nearly unbearable. The air is stuffy and clammy and only CDs to already annoyed passengers distress. <p /> Your service levels have already made me decide that even though you are my local airport I will always use Manchester first, heck I flew from heathrow the other day and the 4am start from lime street was much more pleasant than this place.
