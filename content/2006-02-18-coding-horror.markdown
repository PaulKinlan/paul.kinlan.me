summary: I love Coding Horror and want to emulate its crisp, clean design on my own
  blog. My current design is bloated, slow, and hard to read. I plan to back up my
  template and experiment with a simpler layout next week.

Coding Horror [<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/</a>] is a brilliant blog.  It is the kind of blog that I like to read at the moment, it has some insighful entries and is just generally a good blog to read.  I wish I could style myself around this Blog.  <p />I might try the layout of that site in my own blog because it is very crisp and clean, my site is bloated, slow and ugly colours.<p />I am pretty sure people find my entries hard to read.<p />I know having a good looking blog doesn't make a good blog, but I think a blog that is easy to read and to follow is far better.<p />Anyway over the next week I will take a backup of this template and try a simpler much crisper layout.<p />
