Coding Horror [<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/</a>] is a brilliant blog.  It is the kind of blog that I like to read at the moment, it has some insighful entries and is just generally a good blog to read.  I wish I could style myself around this Blog.  <p />I might try the layout of that site in my own blog because it is very crisp and clean, my site is bloated, slow and ugly colours.<p />I am pretty sure people find my entries hard to read.<p />I know having a good looking blog doesn't make a good blog, but I think a blog that is easy to read and to follow is far better.<p />Anyway over the next week I will take a backup of this template and try a simpler much crisper layout.<p />
