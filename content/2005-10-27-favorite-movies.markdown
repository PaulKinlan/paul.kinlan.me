summary: YMDB.com is a great site for listing your favorite movies and finding others
  with similar tastes.  While the current interface is a bit tedious for adding and
  sorting films, it's still a worthwhile resource. I'd love to see an AJAX-style update
  to improve the user experience. Check out my profile for some examples of how I
  use YMDB.

Check out [YMDB.com](http://www.YMDB.com), it is a simple and easy to use site that allows you to list your favorite films and see who else likes what you like.<p />I think it would suit an AJAX Style interface because adding in titles and moving them through the lists is pretty tedious.  Other than that it is good.<p />[My Profile](http://www.ymdb.com/kinlan/l29716_ukuk.html).<p />
