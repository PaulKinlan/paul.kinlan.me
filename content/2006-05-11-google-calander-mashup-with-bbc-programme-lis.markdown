summary: I've created a tool that converts BBC program listings into iCal format,
  allowing you to subscribe to a calendar of your favorite shows.  Just add the program
  keyword to the end of \"http://www.kinlan.co.uk/bbc/\" (e.g., \"http://www.kinlan.co.uk/bbc/breakfast\")
  to get the iCal feed.  You can then add this feed to Google Calendar, MS Outlook,
  or other calendar applications to stay updated on program schedules.  I'm still
  developing this, so feedback and suggestions are welcome!

I have developed a little program that converts a BBC Listing into an iCal format file.<p />Simply put the keyword of the programs you want to be alerted for at the end of the following url "http://www.kinlan.co.uk/bbc/" and it will return a calendar iCal file with the events for the related programs over the next week.<p />Examples are:<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/bbc/breakfast">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/bbc/breakfast</a><a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/bbc/top%20gear">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/bbc/top%20gear</a><a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/bbc/ross">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/bbc/ross</a><p />You can use this url in your Google Calendar (<a href="http://calendar.google.com">http://calendar.google.com</a>) by simply clicking on the manage calendar link, then on "Add calendar" link in the other calendars section; Select the "<a>Public Calendar Address</a>" tab and then enter the url that you want to subscribe too.<p />I will be working on it more, but with this file you can link it to your Google Calendar account so that you can see when BBC programs will be on TV, it also imports into MS Outlook.<p />Let me know of any suggestions :) and problems<a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a><p />
