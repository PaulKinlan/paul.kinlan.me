summary: I contacted Google about using my AdSense account with IE7's SiteSearch through
  OpenSearch.  Unfortunately, they don't currently allow anything but their own search
  boxes.  I think this is a limitation and they said they'd consider it, but for now,
  using AdSense with IE7's OpenSearch provider is not permitted.

title: Google Adsense for Search and IE7 Openseach Provider

I managed to speak to the Google Adsense for Search team about using my Google Adsene Account in the SiteSearch in IE7, suffice to say I was correct in my first guess:  You are not allowed to use anything but their search boxes.  I think this is a bit limiting, but the person I spoke to said they would pass it to their product team for consideration.<p />So in summary, using IE 7's open search provider with Adsense is a no no.<p />
