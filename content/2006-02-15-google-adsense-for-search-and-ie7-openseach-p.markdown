title: Google Adsense for Search and IE7 Openseach Provider

I managed to speak to the Google Adsense for Search team about using my Google Adsene Account in the SiteSearch in IE7, suffice to say I was correct in my first guess:  You are not allowed to use anything but their search boxes.  I think this is a bit limiting, but the person I spoke to said they would pass it to their product team for consideration.<p />So in summary, using IE 7's open search provider with Adsense is a no no.<p />
