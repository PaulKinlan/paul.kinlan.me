summary: I've been working on AJAX Tagger version 2 and it's ready for everyday use!  It
  leverages APIs from Yahoo, Amazon, Flickr, and Technorati, along with Wikipedia
  and even your own site's content to find related articles.  It's all AJAX-based,
  uses a unique request queue, and outputs in both OPML and HTML. Plus, it even suggests
  related Amazon products. Currently, it's IE-only, so check it out at www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2
  and let me know your thoughts! The UI/UX needs some polish, but that's next on my
  list.
