summary: I've moved my blog from Blogger to my own domain, kinlan.co.uk.  I'm still
  using Blogger's software, but hosting it myself will give me better tracking.  I'm
  very impressed with Blogger!

Moved the Blog To Kinlan.co.ukI have moved the blog onto <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/index.html">Kinlan.co.uk</a>, still using the blogger stuff. But I thought it would be nice to have it in my own domain so I can track it better.... I am really impressed with <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> :)
