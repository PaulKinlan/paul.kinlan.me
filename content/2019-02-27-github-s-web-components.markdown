summary: While searching for a markdown editor on webcomponents.org to simplify blog
  posting, I discovered a useful collection of web components by Github. I was already
  familiar with their <time-element> but was pleasantly surprised to find such a comprehensive
  and easy-to-use set of elements.

I was looking for a quick markdown editor on [https://www.webcomponents.org/](https://www.webcomponents.org/) so that I can make posting to this blog easier and I stumbled across a neat set of components by [github](https://www.webcomponents.org/author/github).

I knew that they had the `<time-element>` but I didn't know they had a such a nice and simple set of useful elements.
