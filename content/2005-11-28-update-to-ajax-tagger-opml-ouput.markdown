published: true

I have updeated the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">Ajax Tagger 2.0</a> to now support Related Searches more.  Now it outputs in OPML the RSS feeds to search engines like MSN, Technorati and Google Blog Search.  I need to find more search engines that output to RSS. <p />Does anyone know any good search engines that output to RSS?<br />Does anyone know how to make Google or Yahoo output in RSS?<p />
