summary: I've updated my Ajax Tagger 2.0 tool!  It now provides related search results
  and outputs them as OPML, including RSS feeds for search engines like MSN, Technorati,
  and Google Blog Search.  I'm looking for more search engines that offer RSS output.  If
  you know of any, especially for Google or Yahoo, please share!

I have updeated the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">Ajax Tagger 2.0</a> to now support Related Searches more.  Now it outputs in OPML the RSS feeds to search engines like MSN, Technorati and Google Blog Search.  I need to find more search engines that output to RSS. <p />Does anyone know any good search engines that output to RSS?Does anyone know how to make Google or Yahoo output in RSS?<p />
