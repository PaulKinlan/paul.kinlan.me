summary: I accidentally discovered that Twitter has implemented PWA shortcuts, a feature
  that allows websites and web apps to provide users with quick access to common actions.
  This is a great step towards bridging the gap between web and native applications,
  allowing websites to provide a more app-like experience.

I thought this was rather cool and I discovered it by accident, but it looks like Twitter implemented [shortcuts](https://web.dev/app-shortcuts/).

It's great to see web sites and web apps being able to do things that users expect installed applications to be able to do.
