One of the searches that came from Google to my site asked the following "c# convert date from uk to usa".<p />Now I don't really know exactly what the user was asking for, but I presume it is something fairly simple.  The way that I would convert a UK date into a US date is as follows.<p />Read in the UK date, short format/long format whatever into a DateTime field.  The output the date time using a US locale. <p />The following code works in vs2005.<p />CultureInfo cultEnGb = new CultureInfo("en-GB");<br />CultureInfo cultEnUs = new CultureInfo("en-US");<br />DateTime dtGb = Convert.ToDateTime(textBox1.Text, cultEnGb.DateTimeFormat);<br />textBox2.Text = dtGb.ToString(cultEnUs.DateTimeFormat.ShortDatePattern);<p />It reads in the date and tries to load the text as a UK Date from the first textbox and then it uses the US locale to output the string into the second textbox.<p />
