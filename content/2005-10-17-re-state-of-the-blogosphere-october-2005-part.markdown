<a href="http://www.sifry.com">David Silfry</a> of <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a> fame has updated his blog with a new entry about the state of the Blogosphere. <br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">As of October 2005, Technorati is now tracking 19.6 Million weblogs The total number of weblogs tracked continues to double about every 5 months The blogosphere is now over 30 times as big as it was 3 years ago, with no signs of letup in growth About 70,000 new weblogs are created every day About a new weblog is created each second 2% - 8% of new weblogs per day are fake or spam weblogs Between 700,000 and 1.3 Million posts are made each day About 33,000 posts are created per hour, or 9.2 posts per second An additional 5.8% of posts (or about 50,000 posts/day) seen each day are from spam or fake blogs, on average</blockquote><br /><i>[Via <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000343.html">Sifry's Alerts</a>]</i><p />His entries tend to be quite informative, but are purely his [Technoratis] take on the Blogosphere.  He seems to be quite encouraged with the Stats and states that the growth indications are still there.<p />What I would like to hear is more information about his take on the API's how Technorati plans on leading this area.  My personal opinion is that Technoartia have made a great start, but there is so much they could do to add extra value to their services with regards to API's.<p />One of these things is to let the community know that they are taking note of feature requests!  It appears that on their Wiki, they don't even confrim that certain suggestions are helpful or unhelpful or if a certain feature is a really cool idea.<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
