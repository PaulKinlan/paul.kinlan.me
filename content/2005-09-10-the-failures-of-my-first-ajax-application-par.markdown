summary: In part 8 of \"Failures of my First AJAX Application,\" I discuss the lack
  of traffic generated by the application. Initially, I hoped for ad revenue, but
  I've realized that user engagement is more important. My focus now is on improving
  the application and planning a marketing campaign to highlight its benefits.

title: 'The Failures of my First AJAX Application: Part 8'

---
This is the 8th installment of my Failures of my First Ajax Applicaiton and is titled "It didn't generate much in the way of extra traffic".<p />There is not too much to say for this one really.  I was hoping that it would generate a lot of needed interest in my web page so that potentially I might be able to earn some ad revenue, but after working on the project a little I have realised that revenue is not too important, just getting people to use it is more important.<p />Once I am happy with the requirements for the next version I will have to work out some sort of "marketing" campaign, which will really highlight the benefits of this application.<p />
