title: Google sending me c# searches.

---
I was looking through my logs and I have seen that google is sending me more and more c# searches.  I am thinking that when people who come to this blog see it, they are probably impressed that there is not too much about c# on it.  So from this day forth I will try and answer at least one google search about c#<p />
