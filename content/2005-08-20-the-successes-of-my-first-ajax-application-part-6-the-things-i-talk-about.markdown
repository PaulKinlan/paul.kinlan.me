summary: I've been reflecting on the direction of my blog, \"C#, .Net Framework.\"  I
  feel the name is too limiting, given my recent posts on topics like IE7, AJAX, Firefox,
  and XMLHttpRequest.  I plan to broaden the scope while keeping the content technical.  I
  also want to increase reader interaction, possibly by crowdsourcing a new name for
  the blog.

title: 'The Successes of my first AJAX Application: Part 6 - The things I talk about'

I have been thinking for a long time about what I want to include in this Blog.  I have several concerns.  Firstly the name of the Blog "C#, .Net Framework" I believe limits the scope of the blog.  I shouldn’t really be talking about what I am now, technically.  I think I might change the name of the blog into something a little more generic, but at the same time it will have a larger target area for audience attraction.  The Blog will stay technical; I will try not to include personal entries into it, but I want to have a broader scope to the Blog.  Over the past month or so, I have been Blogging about Internet Explorer 7 (IE7), AJAX, Firefox, XMLHttpRequest and much more.  I still have plenty to talk about though including current technical news, image manipulation (I did a fisheye effect a while back)<p />I will, in the future, change the name of the blog.  But rather than choosing it myself I might open it up to the masses to see if they can suggest a new name for the blog.  This might in the long term be a publicity stunt, but I do need to get people visiting my blog and I would like to get a little more interaction in the blog.<p />
