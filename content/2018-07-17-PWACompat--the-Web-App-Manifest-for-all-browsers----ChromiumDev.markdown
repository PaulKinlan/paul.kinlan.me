Enter PWACompat, a library that takes your Web App Manifest and automatically inserts relevant meta or link tags for icons of different sizes, the favicon, startup mode, colors etc.

I was amazed by this library, and I'm glad to see it getting a bit more attention. It was the first time I actually saw the Splash Screen on iOS work in the last 5 years and he generates them in a really neat way - he generates the image on the fly based on the exact screen size of the device and base64 encodes the image... it also fills in a lot of the rest of the gaps in the Safari Add To Homescreen story.

If you're building a PWA I would include it.
