  class library design principles, especially regarding method overloading and cohesion.  I
  highly recommend checking it out and plan to incorporate these best practices into
  my own coding.'

I just realised that I never followed my own advice to watch the videos on MSDN.  I just watched
[Designing .NET Class Libraries: Member Types](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/programming/classlibraries/membertypes/) and I have to admit, this guy talks sense :)  
<p />
Even though I have done a lot of c#, it is very interesting what "the" people talk about and their basic standards. I liked his arguments for cohesion of overloaded methods.  I think I will try and follow that advice.
