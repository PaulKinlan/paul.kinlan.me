<p>If like me you live in the UK and you also have a Google Adsense account, keep the money in the account until the $/£ exchange rate comes down a bit.  I got my first payment from Google and the money I got for it was pitiful (especially considering it took me a year to get up to the limit).</p> <p>Aditionally, I also belive if you are an advertiser in the UK you are also getting done by, 1p &gt; 1c by almost twice as much.  Therefore unless Google opperate an exchange rate program where my advertising gets a higher prominence than the equivilant "centage" advert then us UK advertisers are getting a raw deal.</p> <p>So for now I have suspended my adverts that I sell and I am going to keep the money in the Google account for longer if I ever recieve another payment.</p> <p>tags: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/google" rel="tag">google</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/adsense" rel="tag">adsense</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/con" rel="tag">con</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/adwords" rel="tag">adwords</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-115567081622989060?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
