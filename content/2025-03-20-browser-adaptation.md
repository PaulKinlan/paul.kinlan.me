Something that I've been thinking about a lot recently is that the medium that is the web. It enables a lot of things that only the web can so this post by Brad Woods really resonated with me and it talks about how the web can be used to adapt stories to different mediums.

> Different mediums convey information in unique ways and creators interpret the same story through unique perspectives. Tolkien gives relatively little detail of what Middle-earth looks like, leaving much of the work to the reader's imagination. Jackson on the other hand paints vivid pictures. Tolkien emphasizes the length of the journey by detailing every step, making readers feel the weight of the adventure. Jackson focuses on the major events, creating a fast-paced narrative. Neither approach is superior. Each explores Middle-earth from a different angle. Adaptations allow audiences to make a deeper connection with the story, enriching their understanding and appreciation of the original work.

What the browser offers

> The browser offers the following communication tools:
>
> ▪text
> ▪image
> ▪video
> ▪sound
> ▪interactivity
> ▪video game environments (2D and 3D)
> With these, we can recreate most story mediums. For example, using image and text to make a comic book or sound to make a podcast. This gives the creator freedom to choose the communication tool(s) that best fit the story they want to tell.

Yes. YES. YES! I love it.

He also discusses the idea of [Personalization](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/story/browser-adaptation#:~:text=their%20own%20narrative.-,Personalize,-The%20browser%27s%20localisation) and [Interactivity](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/story/browser-adaptation#:~:text=one%20particular%20telling.-,Interactivity,-Interactivity%20enables%20more). Quadruple yes! The web as a medium is so incredibly versatile and I love seeing people explore that.

In 2014 Jeremy Keith published a post ["Continuum"](https://adactio.com/journal/6692) and it touches on a different aspect of the value of the web: it's resilence and ability to adapt to the devices it runs on and the browsers it runs in.

I'm still working on how I want to be able to express the value of the web more, especially in a world where it looks like the youth of today who grew up with mediums such as YouTube, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram don't naturally see the web as a medium that they can use to express themselves (or even enjoy).

As a side note, this blog is a gold mine of neat experiments and explainers
