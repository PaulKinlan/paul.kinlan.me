I am trying to extend the reach of this site recently, especially with my Tag Directory.  I will go over how I created the tag directory soon, and I will also show you the source code (it is really simple).<p />Under each post at the moment I link directly to Amazon, I intend to link to a landing page on my site first now which will host very specific information about the books that I recomend.  All the information will be dynamic but I hope to be able to tailor the results better and thus provide a better service to my readers.<p />As well as this, I intend to make a service to advertise your Amazon Market place books.  This should hopefully help me to sell mine, but it might also help you to sell yours.<p />Let me know what you think.<p />I am also going to write about my telecoms final year project.<p />
