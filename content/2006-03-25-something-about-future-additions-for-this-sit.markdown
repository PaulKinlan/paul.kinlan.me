summary: I'm working on some exciting new features for this site!  First up, I'm improving
  the Tag Directory (more on that soon, including the source code!).  Second, instead
  of linking directly to Amazon, I'll create landing pages with more specific info
  about the books I recommend.  Third, I'm planning a service to advertise Amazon
  Marketplace books, hoping to help both you and me sell more books.  Finally, I'll
  be writing about my final year telecoms project.  Let me know what you think!

title: Something about Future additions for this site

---
I am trying to extend the reach of this site recently, especially with my Tag Directory.  I will go over how I created the tag directory soon, and I will also show you the source code (it is really simple).<p />Under each post at the moment I link directly to Amazon, I intend to link to a landing page on my site first now which will host very specific information about the books that I recomend.  All the information will be dynamic but I hope to be able to tailor the results better and thus provide a better service to my readers.<p />As well as this, I intend to make a service to advertise your Amazon Market place books.  This should hopefully help me to sell mine, but it might also help you to sell yours.<p />Let me know what you think.<p />I am also going to write about my telecoms final year project.<p />
