If all goes well and my flight arrives on time I will be doing a talk at the Berlin GTUG (<a href="http://www.berlin-gtug.org/2010/06/july-2010-berlin-gtug-meeting.html">http://www.berlin-gtug.org/2010/06/july-2010-berlin-gtug-meeting.html</a>) about building HTML based Applications.<p /><div>The talk should be about 45 minutes or a little less and will cover what makes an app an app rather than a web page.  There should be some good examples in there too.<br /><p /><div>I have never been to Berlin before, so I am really excited even though I will only be there for 1 night (and arriving at 4pm)</div> <p /><div>I will post the slides after I have finished and any photos (I hope to get lots :))</div></div>
