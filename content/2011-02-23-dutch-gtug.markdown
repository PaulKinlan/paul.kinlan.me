<span style="">We recently <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/02/chrome-web-store-international-support.html" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);">announced</a> that the Netherlands will be one of the countries that will have the Chrome Web Store available with integrated support for <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/pricing.html#seller" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);">Dutch sellers</a>.<p /> On the 2nd of March 2011 starting at 7pm the Dutch GTUG will be holding an event at Google Amsterdam about HTML5 and the Chrome Web Store.  I will show you some new cool stuff in HTML5 and related technologies and talk to you about how you can use the Chrome Web Store to reach new users.<p /> The event will start promptly at 7pm, so arrive a little earlier after 6:30pm.  I can’t wait to see you there, we have an <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/dutchgtug/pending-events/google-chrome-webstore" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);">Event Information page</a> and a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dGdqMVNMSDdIUUJqbmQ0TWJRT0VnTmc6MQ#gid=0" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);">sign-up form</a>.  If you want to come <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dGdqMVNMSDdIUUJqbmQ0TWJRT0VnTmc6MQ#gid=0" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);">Sign Up Now</a> as places are limited. I will be talking for an hour or so about HTML5 and the Chrome Web Store, showing you some really cool stuff and answering any questions that you have, followed by lighting talks - so if you have anything you want to demo, now is the chance.</span>
