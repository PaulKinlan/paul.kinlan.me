summary: I've successfully integrated WebTorrent streaming and bit torrent URLs into
  my blog! This allows me to distribute content like this test podcast without relying
  solely on my website's bandwidth.  It uses the WebSeed BEP, meaning my site acts
  as a permanent, unchocked seed.  I'm excited to experiment further with this tech
  and explore analytics tracking.

This is a test.  It might not look like much but I have integrated
WebTorrent streaming in to my blog and bit torrent URLs so that 
I can distribute content across the web without relying on my
site.

It does use the WebSeed BEP so that it always has an unchocked
seed (my site).  I am going to start experimenting a little more 
with this to see how to measure analytics etc.
