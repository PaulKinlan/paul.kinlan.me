summary: Microsoft's Start.com has launched a new developer API, possibly using the
  ATLAS framework (precursor to ASP.NET AJAX).  It seems to focus on creating JavaScript-based
  \"Gadgets,\" similar to RSS consumers, that need to be hosted on a server.  The
  API also requires enabling cross-domain data sources in Internet Explorer, a topic
  I've discussed previously.

As well as MSN releasing their Search API's, MSN's own start.com has also released an API, which I think is built with the ATLAS framework that Microsoft are trying to get ready for the release of ASP.net v2.<p />Why do I say ATLAS? because over on [http://start.com/developer/default.htm](http://start.com/developer/default.htm), you will see a link to an ATLAS runtime overview [http://start.com/developer/atlasruntime.aspx](http://start.com/developer/atlasruntime.aspx).<p />All of this requires a bit more investigating :) It is really interesting because it appears that it is all about creating components called Gadgets that JavaScript RSS consumers.... I think. All of which have to be hosted on your own server. I don't know if it has to be IIS specific though.<p />One thing I have noticed from the "Getting Started" is that you need to enable cross domain data sources in Internet Explorer, whichI have already talked about in an earlier post [<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/minor-problem-with-my-ajax-application.html" title="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/minor-problem-with-my-ajax-application.html">here</a>].<p />I need to look in to this too :) I am going to have a busy weekend!<p />
