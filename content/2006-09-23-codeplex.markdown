<p>I have created a project on Codeplex, and I must say that I am really impressed.  If this is Team Foundation Server, then it appears to be mega easy to use.  Much easier than Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest.  It just fits in so nicely with VS2005.</p> <p>I am still experimenting at the moment, and I am having some issues with the fact the VS C# Express, which you have to use for XNA doesn't support Team Foundation integration.</p> <p>I am using a mixture of VS2005 Team Edition,  VS Express and the command line like tf.</p> <p>It is pretty simple once you get used to it :)</p> <p>tags: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/tf" rel="tag">tf</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/team+foundation+server" rel="tag">team foundation server</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/vs2005" rel="tag">vs2005</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/.net" rel="tag">.net</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/rational" rel="tag">rational</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/clearcase" rel="tag">clearcase</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/clearquest" rel="tag">clearquest</a></p>
