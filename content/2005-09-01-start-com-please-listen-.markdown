Start.com/myw3b has been promoted to the main <a href="http://www.Start.com">http://www.Start.com</a> site.  It is a really cool AJAX style web portal that processes Web Feeds (RSS etc) and displays them in a really snazzy HTML Interface.<p />The problem that I have had with it is one that I mentioned ages ago (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/07/startcom-little-annoyance.html">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/07/startcom-little-annoyance.html</a>) and is still there.  It revolves around not being able to cancel a close event on the RSS feed panels that you have when you enter the page.<p />Can Start.com fix this, it really bugs me.<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
