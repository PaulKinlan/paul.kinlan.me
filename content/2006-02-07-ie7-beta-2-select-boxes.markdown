title: IE7 Beta 2 Select Boxes

Remember how in IE6, when you had a SELECT box on the screen it would be rendered as the top most element, this affected menu systems because the select box would appear over the menu and it would look really bad.<p />Well not anymore, IE7 Beta 2 seems to have fixed this.<p />Read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/01/17/514076.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/01/17/514076.aspx</a> for more information, I have checked it out and it works pretty well it seems.<p />I have not tried any extra CSS styles but I hope they work.<p />
