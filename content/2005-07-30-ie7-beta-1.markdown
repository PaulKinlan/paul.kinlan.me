<p>I have been playing with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ie" rel="tag">IE7</a>, I quite like it. Not played around with it too much. I had to make sure that my site worked with it :) And it does, however I did notice that my feed is not discovered automatically. Maybe because it is an ATOM feed, but I don't know. I also noticed that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ie" rel="tag">IE7 </a>doesn't seem to be completly consistant with how it discovers feeds on a page. I would love to know how it auto discovers RSS/ATOM feeds.</p><p>I also like the tabbed browsing, I like the new empty tab on the right of all the other tabs so I can easily open up a new tab. I don't know if I will still like it in the future. I still don't think tabbed browsing is the "correct" UI way of doing things. I think it kinda breaks the whole Windows UI process. For one, if I want to compare sites side-by-side I still have to have more than one window open. Would it be hard to develop tabbed browsing that allows you to be a bit more flexible with the application. Futher more, what I like about having multiple windows open is that I can easily see what pages I have open (even when minimised) simply by looking at the task bar. In a tabbed environment I can't do that and I really miss that type of feature. Of course I can still use multiple instances of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ie" rel="tag">IE7</a>. But I want the benefits of Tabbed browsing and Multi-Window browsing all in one. A middle solution could be the way office works, with each document is a new window. Another idea might be better tool-tips on the task bar items.</p><p>I have also read that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ie" rel="tag">IE7 </a>CSS 2.0 support is being upgraded in Beta 2. But a lot of CSS rendering <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/29/445242.aspx">bugs </a>have been fixed in this build.</p><p>Anyway to summarise:</p><ul>
<li>How are RSS Feeds Discovered.</li>
<li>Does IE Support ATOM in this Beta.</li>
<li>What happens when I click a auto discovered feed.</li>
<li>Is this the final way tabbed browsing will work.</li>
<ul>
<li>I like the Blank Insert Tab Tab.</li>
<li>I am not keen on not knowing what pages I am looking at through the task bar.</li>
</ul>
</ul><br />
