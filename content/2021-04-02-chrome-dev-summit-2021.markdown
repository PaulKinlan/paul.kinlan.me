summary: I'm starting to think about Chrome Dev Summit 2022.  Top of mind is everyone's
  safety with the ongoing pandemic and how to make the event as inclusive as possible.  I
  really value the connections and hallway track of in-person events, but also the
  reach of online.  I loved the CDS 2020 workshops and office hours, and believe we
  should expand on those.  Content-wise, I want to focus on what makes the web amazing,
  showcasing great experiences, and exploring key technologies like Core Web Vitals,
  Privacy Sandbox, PWAs, and Project Fugu.  Also, more content alongside talks, please!
  And maybe shorter, more impactful online presentations?

Some early thoughts about what is important to me:

* The pandemic is still here.
* I don't want people to potentially get sick
* In-person events are exclusionary by their nature, want to bring as many people from as wide of set of backgrounds as possible.
* Hallway track is hugely important
* I liked workshops in CDS 2020. Google should do more of this free education.
* Office hours and connections with developers are important to me.
* Every talk really should have a lot of guiding content launched with it. No content then No talk.
* I miss seeing my friends.

Content thoughts:

* Show why the web is amazing. 
* Showcase great experiences
* Do we need to constantly show business success?
* CWV, Privacy Sandbox, PWA + Fugu.
* Developers love what's new: CSS, JS, DevTools.
* Maybe we shouldn't have a 3-hour live stream. Keynote + Content drop.
* Should do lots of free workshops. Rachel Andrew, Maximiliano Firtman, Tammy Everts, Marcy Sutton, Tim Kadlec were amazing.
