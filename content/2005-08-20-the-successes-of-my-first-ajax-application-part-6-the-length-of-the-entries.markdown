summary: This blog post discusses the ideal length of blog entries. It argues that
  both too short and too long posts can be detrimental to a blog's success.  Short
  posts can appear superficial, while overly long ones can bore readers. The author
  aims for a balance, using shorter entries for critiques and longer, focused articles
  for more in-depth topics.  This particular post, part of a series on the author's
  first AJAX application, exemplifies this approach by being broken down into smaller,
  manageable segments.

I will keep this chapter short.  Whilst looking at many Blogs, I have noticed that nearly everyone but the most successful Blogs are either a) too short or b) too long.  I feel that too shorter an entry all it really shows is that you are linking to something or don’t have too much to say.  The longer Blog posts are mostly to long winded and I get bored halfway through.  There is only so much I can read about a cats eating habits. <p />Therefore I hope to have a mixture of both, the short entries will have a bit of a critique in and the longer ones such as my "Success and failures" will be more articley, but keep on subject and hopefully be useful and interesting.<p />For instance, I am posting this chapter as a series of more manageable set of entries.<p />
