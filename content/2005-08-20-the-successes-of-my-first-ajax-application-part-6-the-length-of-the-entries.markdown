I will keep this chapter short.  Whilst looking at many Blogs, I have noticed that nearly everyone but the most successful Blogs are either a) too short or b) too long.  I feel that too shorter an entry all it really shows is that you are linking to something or donâ€™t have too much to say.  The longer Blog posts are mostly to long winded and I get bored halfway through.  There is only so much I can read about a cats eating habits. <p />Therefore I hope to have a mixture of both, the short entries will have a bit of a critique in and the longer ones such as my "Success and failures" will be more articley, but keep on subject and hopefully be useful and interesting.<p />For instance, I am posting this chapter as a series of more manageable set of entries.<p />
