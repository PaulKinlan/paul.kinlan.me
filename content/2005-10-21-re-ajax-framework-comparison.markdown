summary: I came across Matt Harrison's post discussing the challenges of choosing
  between various Ajax toolkits and frameworks, and it really resonated with me. He
  highlighted the OSA Foundation's survey of Ajax/JavaScript libraries, which covers
  a wide range of options like Dojo, DWR, JSON-RPC-JAVA, MochiKit, Prototype, Rico,
  SAJAX, Scriptaculous, Xajax, and Sack.  It's fascinating to see how these libraries
  address different aspects of Ajax development.  This makes me rethink my recent
  work on the backend XMLHttpRequest for Ajax Tagger Version 2, and whether leveraging
  existing solutions may have been more efficient. Links to the OSA Foundation, Michael
  Mahemoff's framework information, and my own previous blog post on Ajax layers are
  included for further exploration.

This is a really interesting post that I need to read more into.<blockquote>
<p>[Matt Harrison](http://panela.blog-city.com/ajax_explosion.htm) was talking about making choices between various Ajax toolkits, frameworks, or libraries.</p>
<p /><p>He linked over to [the OSA foundation](http://wiki.osafoundation.org/) and their [Survey of AJAX/JavaScript Libraries](http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Projects/AjaxLibraries).</p>
<p /><p>Their survey discusses:</p>

<li>[Sack](http://twilightuniverse.com/projects/sack/)</li>
<p /><p>The world of Ajax libs is an interesting one, as they cover various functionality.</p>
<p /><p>We blogged about the Ajax layers in the past:</p>

<p /><p>NOTE: [Michael Mahemoff also collected framework information](http://www.ajaxpatterns.org/AJAXFrameworks)<p /></p>
</blockquote><i>[Via [Ajaxian](http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/10/ajax_framework_2.html)]</i><p />I have been doing  a lot of backend work with XMLHttpRequest for my Ajax Tagger Version 2, and I am wondering if I should have bothered.  I will look into some of these solutions and see what each offers.<p />
