I was looking around the Internet to see if anyone has automatically loaded a resource file so that you can skin an XAML app.<p />It turns out that it has been done and is quite easy.<p /><a href="http://www.dave5.com/blog/Trackback.aspx?guid=47778bf9-abaf-46a9-aeee-d37ae2658fbe">http://www.dave5.com/blog/Trackback.aspx?guid=47778bf9-abaf-46a9-aeee-d37ae2658fbe</a> shows a simple method (I think based on the link below).  Simply it loads a resource and then assigns it to the application.<p /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mitchw/articles/68541.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/mitchw/articles/68541.aspx</a>: shows a more complete example of how to load a "Style" resource at runtime.  In the styles you can have new visual trees and the like that you would have in any application.<p />Some code to load XAML at runtime can be found
