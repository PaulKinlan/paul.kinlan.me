title: Update about IE7 Feeds not working
published: true
---
I have not been keeping the list of feeds that don't work in IE7 up to date for several reasons.  The major reason is that I was in the middle of emailing Sean Lyndersay who is a Lead Program Manager on the RSS team.<p />He confirmed that the sites I had listed do in fact work with Internet Explorer 7 Beta 1 and that potentially there is a bug in the RSS code that makes all the feeds not viewable.  I confirmed that every single Feed I look at doesn't render correctly anymore.  Anyway, after a little email he said that the RSS code (i think for the conversion of feeds in to the "pretty" form) has been looked at and has been completely re-written for Beta 2.<p />He also confirmed that he has seen some feeds that don't render correctly although in his experience it is intermittent.  However, in my case it is permanent; none of the feeds render, but that might be a configuration issue. <p />Anyway, heres looking forward to Internet Explorer 7 Beta 2!.  Thanks Sean!
