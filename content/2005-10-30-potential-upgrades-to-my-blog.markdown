summary: I'm planning some exciting upgrades to my blog! Soon, each post will feature
  a dynamically generated section at the end, pulling in related content like searches,
  blogs, images, and Wikipedia articles, all based on the post's context.  No caching
  for now, but I'm considering it for the future.  You'll also be able to subscribe
  to an OPML file containing an outline of all this related information for each post.

I have been thinking about adding complete AjaxTag Functionality to my page as a default standard.  That is, at the end of every article there wiil be a section for dynamically generated data, the data will be pulled in on the fly for now.  It will not be cached but I might have to think about that in the future.<p />The information will include realted searches, related blogs, related images, related Wikipedia articles etc.  All of this will be based on the context of the journal entry.<p />At the end of every post you will be able to subscribe to an OPML file with all the results in, i.e An Outline all the related information about the post.<p />
