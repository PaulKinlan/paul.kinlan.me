I have been thinking about adding complete AjaxTag Functionality to my page as a default standard.  That is, at the end of every article there wiil be a section for dynamically generated data, the data will be pulled in on the fly for now.  It will not be cached but I might have to think about that in the future.<p />The information will include realted searches, related blogs, related images, related Wikipedia articles etc.  All of this will be based on the context of the journal entry.<p />At the end of every post you will be able to subscribe to an OPML file with all the results in, i.e An Outline all the related information about the post.<p />
