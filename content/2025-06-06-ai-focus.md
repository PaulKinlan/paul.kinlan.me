I've launched a new blog. It's called AI Focus, and it's dedicated to exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and web development. My goals of the blog is to cover a range of topics that I think are going to affect the web and web development in the coming years.

Why? I think that the nature of the web has changed and it will change even more in the coming years. I love the web and web development, but I don't think we can idly sit by and assume that "the web will always win". I don't "always bet on the web", I bet on the people who build for the medium that is the web, that is the users, the authors, the developers, the designers, the creators and web browser engineers. I think we are going to have to adapt to the changes that "AI", or at least the technology that is Large Language Models, bring to the web, and I want to be at the forefront of that change.

I'm experimenting with a more essay focus to the writing which pose more questions than answers at the moment. I've been silently writing articles on it for the past couple of weeks, covering topics like:

* [The future of embedding](https://aifoc.us/embedding/)?
* [The future of linking](https://aifoc.us/a-link-is-all-you-need/)?
* [Will there be a super-app](https://aifoc.us/super-apps/)?

My buddy [Andre Bandarra](https://aifoc.us/authors/andreban/) has also written some great pieces about [Mashups](https://aifoc.us/ai-powered-site-mashups/) and [assistance in web development](https://aifoc.us/ai-assisted-webdev/)

Let me know what you think, and also what topics you'd like to see covered in the future. I'm always looking for new ideas and perspectives, and I want to expand my understanding and opinion.
