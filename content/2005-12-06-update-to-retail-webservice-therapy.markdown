summary: I recently discussed the lack of retail web service APIs for major companies
  like Tesco, Dixon's, and HMV.  I've since discovered an ASDA Soap API on maskell.uk.com.  I'm
  impressed by this development, though I'm uncertain how it's implemented (possibly
  screen scraping). Check it out!

title: Update to Retail Webservice Therapy

---
A little while ago I <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/retail-web-service-therapy.html">wrote a little blog entry</a> about the fact there are not many (if any) retail based Web Serivce APIS.  That is for things such as Tesco's, Dixon's and HMV etc.  Well it seems that over on <a href="http://www.maskell.uk.com/">www.maskell.uk.com</a> there is an answer.  There is an <a href="http://www.maskell.uk.com/webServices/Asda/Store.asmx" title="" target="">Soap API</a> for <a href="http://www.asda.co.uk/" title="" target="">ASDA</a>.  All I can say is Wow.  I am not too sure how he does it but it might inlvove screen scraping or something.  I am not too sure.  But anyway it is cool.  Give it a go!<p />
