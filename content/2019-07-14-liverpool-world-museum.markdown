summary: I recently took my kids to the Liverpool World Museum. While some areas like
  the Space and Time section and the Bug enclosure were a bit underwhelming, the newly
  opened Egyptian exhibit was fantastic!

I took the kids to the Liverpool World History Museum the other week, it was pretty neat. 

The Space and Time section has not changed in about 30 years, a large section of the Bug enclosure was closed off, and the Aquarium seemed a tad smaller than I remember. The Egyptian section was open (it wasn't when I last went) and it was rather awesome.
