* [The Bullshit Web — Pixel Envy](https://pxlnv.com/blog/bullshit-web/)
* Read [The Web is not Poor Man’s Native | in progress](https://cwilso.com/2015/05/29/the-web-is-not-poor-mans-native/)
  * Comments: [The web is not poor man’s native (2015) | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31967011) - It was interesting to read
* Reflecting on how I write these notes - I read a lot of websites and then I drop the link in to `logseq` and then use my plugin to get the pages title, I noticed everyone always has the site name at the end of the page "— {title}" or "| {title}" and I'm just left wondering why there isn't a `<site>` element (or something similar) that you can use to describe the site or origin that the page is on. It's visually unappealing for me, but more broadly I wonder how it's rendered in other assistive technology?
  * There is `<meta name="application-name">` that does something kinda similar.
  * schema.org has https://schema.org/WebSite and an associated name.
  * Am I missing something?
* [WHATWG Stream Visualizer](https://surma.dev/lab/whatwg-stream-visualizer/lab.html) by Surma (use's titles right ;))
  * Was very happy to stumble across this. I was thinking about this more in the context of WebCodecs and being able to visually construct the TransformStream to generate frames.
* Read [sharp - High performance Node.js image processing](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/performance)
* Read [Five things we've learned about Web Stories](https://blog.google/web-creators/five-things-weve-learned-about-web-stories/)
  * I just don't see them - I find it interesting that Google still does roll outs just in specific locales, but the messaging is global :\
