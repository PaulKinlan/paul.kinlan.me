* Created [Adding ActivityPub to your static site](https://paul.kinlan.me/adding-activity-pub-to-your-static-site/) and also added a lot more functionality to my site. I can now show Likes, "Boosts" and replies.
  * See [Interactions from around the fediverse with https://paul.kinlan.me/adding-activity-pub-to-your-static-site/](https://paul.kinlan.me/api/activitypub-html/render.ts?url=https%3a%2f%2fpaul.kinlan.me%2fadding-activity-pub-to-your-static-site%2f) as an example
  * Added resources to [ActivityPub](../entry/activitypub) to help people find the best information
* [ML](../entry/ml)
  * [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/load_data/images.ipynb#scrollTo=rN-Pc6Zd6awg) - Colab is a rather amazing tool, I've also built some dashboards in the past with it but for ML with Tensorflow it's worked really well.
  * I've started my first project to help me learn [GitHub - PaulKinlan/button-and-link-scraper](https://github.com/PaulKinlan/button-and-link-scraper) the goal is to check to see an anchor on a page looks like a button, and should possibly be a button. It's a small A11Y feature, but something that I think is hard to test just from the HTML.
    * I had a lot of fun building this even before I got to training any NN, for a list of URLs I find all the button-like elements and screenshot them, and I also find all the links too and screenshot them.
    * The NN is just using a simple image classifier, right now for anything that looks like a button it has a 100% accuracy, which I am sure is suspicious.
  * Lots of research
    * [AI and Machine Learning For Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence: Amazon.co.uk: 9781492078197: Books](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Machine-Learning-Coders-Programmers-Intelligence/dp/1492078190) by [Laurence Moroney](../entry/laurence-moroney) - I'm familiar with the basics of NN and this book got me back up to speed and the latest developments (Convolution Networks, Recurrent Networks etc). I was really good to get a sense about how image classification works, Image Segmentation, Text prediction- I had no clue but a lot of it is quite logical on retrospect.
      * This talk from IO complements the book - [Machine Learning Zero to Hero (Google I/O'19) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwVg9jCtqaU)
    * TensorFlow
      * [TensorFlow basics  |  TensorFlow Core](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/basics)
      * [Generate Artificial Faces with CelebA Progressive GAN Model  |  TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf_hub_generative_image_module)
      * [Image segmentation  |  TensorFlow Core](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation)
    * Transformers - GPT, BERT, Copilot and others use this and it seems like a promising area that I should at least know the basics of.
      * Started to do some research because I'd heard about it - this video was a good intro [Transfer learning and Transformer models (ML Tech Talks) - YouTube]([Transfer learning and Transformer models (ML Tech Talks) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE3NfEULV6k&t=939s)) and this book is great too https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1098103246/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 - both give a good overview, personally I found https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 a bit over my head.
    * Other bits:

      * [Jay Alammar – Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.](https://jalammar.github.io/) < Has a good post about how Stable Diffusion works.
