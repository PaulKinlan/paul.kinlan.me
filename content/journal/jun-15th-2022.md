* Watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8slZJrTK3nE
* Read [Obscure CSS: Implicit List-Item Counter](https://kizu.dev/list-item-counter/)
  * I've had many developers complain about the lack of attention to counters.
* [AnimatiSS - A nice, colorful collection of CSS animations for your projects](https://xsgames.co/animatiss/)
  * Neat - I love tools like this that just let me copy and paste and start using. Reminds me of [Open Props: sub-atomic styles](https://open-props.style)
    * Also - neat. .style domains.
* [HTML5 Rocks - A resource for open web HTML5 developers](https://www.html5rocks.com) Redirects.
  * We are on the final stretch of moving all the content across to [web.dev](https://web.dev) and [HTML5 Rocks - A resource for open web HTML5 developers](https://html5rocks.com) - it's been a long time coming and I'm glad that we are still able to preserve the content.
