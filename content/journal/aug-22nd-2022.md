* Read [Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/) - not really sure what to make of it. On one hand I totally get it, on the other who knows how to actually quantify this?
  * I know the Pixel 6 has a power rail that can be measured and you could look at the impact of loading a page in terms of power usage, but measuring on the client is only one aspect, how do you quantify the impact of any server interaction.
* I was building a very simple site that made use of just plain old semantic HTML and no fancy styling or a need of a 'framework' for tables or columns, it's just a dynamic document and for the life of my my Google-fu failed me, so I asked a question on Twitter about needing a [simple CSS frameworks](https://twitter.com/Paul_Kinlan/status/1560769014787411969) - I'm very happy Twitter exists for questions like this. I couldn't think of the term that I wanted, but I had a vague notion of needing something that replaces the default stylesheet that the browser would apply (and I remember seeing one styled for Tufte). It turns out it's called no-class or [Classless CSS](../entry/classless-css)< I'll keep that page up to date as I find more.
  * I built a site to make it easier to compare the output of each in one place https://classless-css-demo.deno.dev/ , code here: https://github.com/PaulKinlan/classless-css-demo
* Deno gets me
  * I managed to finally get back to playing with Deno. It's good. Very very good.
  * For me, Deno Deploy is what Vercel once was. Quite happy so far with it. It just feels like building a web app.
  * I ended up writing my own request router and it was surprisingly smooth to get going. [Code here](https://github.com/PaulKinlan/ChromeStatusLite/blob/main/main.ts#L41) if you are interested.
* Read [Color & Contrast](https://colorandcontrast.com/#/)
  * This is an incredible resource. I'm still reading it.
