* New CRUX available - https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chrome-ux-report-announce/c/N5B3F9QVOmY - July data set.
  * [Chrome UX Report - Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/)
  * CrUX is probably one of the most valuable datasources that you don't yet use.
* Watched: [What are Chrome release channels? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL1guL5n9PU) - I love Sam's videos, he creates clear and concise content that is easy to understand but covers what I need to know.
* WASM coming to Vercel Edge ?
  * [PHP 7.4.20 - phpinfo()](https://edge-php.vercel.app/) - I'm actually curious to see what this actually means (not the PHP link). I always had this idea of transportable compute (see unfinished blog post - https://paul.kinlan.me/fullstack-wasm/) where you can run the same logic, push it up to a server and run the compute there if you want (if it's faster or cheaper than locally),.... I know it's different from what Vercel is thinking, but there's a lot of options here.... I should really finish the post.
