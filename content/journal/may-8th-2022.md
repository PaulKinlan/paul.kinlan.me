* [Macbook](../entry/macbook) - M1 edition 16 inch
  * It's damn amazing.
    * Keyboard is so much better and it has real function keys
    * Screen and Battery are amazing
  * The bad
    * The camera is diabolical.
    * For my needs, it should have one more USB-C port.
* Read [Different visualizations for Memory tool · Issue #36 · MicrosoftEdge/DevTools · GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/DevTools/issues/36)
  * This looks like an interesting way to visualise heap snapshots. I'm pretty keen to see more people build on the platform
  * Idly musing on [Chrome Dev Tools](../entry/chrome-dev-tools) as a platform
    * [Extending DevTools - Chrome Developers](https:/developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/devtools/)
    * [Puppeteer - Tools for Web Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) - Browser automation. Also, I miss [Eric Bidelman](../entry/eric-bidelman) :D
    * [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) - What powers the browser automation and DevTools.
    * It's a platform and we don't realise it or treat it like one. As a team we should probably be thinking more about empowering developers to build more tools for their users directly in to where they need them. How could we work with the likes of Adobe and Figma etc to connect their products to the browser?
* Read https://twitter.com/ChallengesCss/status/1523260400698937344
  * I'm aways amazed by what people are able to do with CSS and great design sense.
* Made [logseq](../entry/logseq) exporter to hugo format
  * https://github.com/PaulKinlan/logseq-plugins/tree/main/export_hugo
  * Not a huge amount of features but it outputs the journal and associated pages
  * Need to get it to output the files directly and not a zip file.
    * DONE research file system access with the logseq plugins
      * https://logseq.github.io/plugins/
      * https://logseq.github.io/plugins/interfaces/ILSPluginUser.html#FileStorage
        * They really need a tech writer. Nothing is documented.
        * `LSPluginFileStorage` is a [GoogleWhack](../entry/googlewhack)
      * Found a way `doAction`
        * await top.apis.doAction(["mkdir", `${baseDirectory}/${directory}`]);
        * await top.apis.doAction(["openDir", ""]);
        * await top.apis.doAction([
    "writeFile",
    "",
    `${baseDirectory}/${file.fileName}`,
    file.content,
  ]);
