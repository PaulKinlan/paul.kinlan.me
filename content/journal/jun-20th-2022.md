* Read ["Dune" (the movie), annotated - by Max Read - Read Max](https://maxread.substack.com/p/dune-annotated)
  * Was referenced in a bug fix for [GitHub - PaulKinlan/logseq-webpage-title](https://github.com/PaulKinlan/logseq-webpage-title) was a good read.
* Sponsored [Sponsor @firasdib on GitHub Sponsors Â· GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/firasdib)
  * I use this tool so many times it's crazy. Glad there is a sponsorship option.
* Thinking about sponsorships in general
  * Chrome has [Framework fund](https://blog.opencollective.com/chromes-framework-of-open-source-investment/) and the [UI fund](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdN0Y_MpvnlhflX9cBZS7tR24MF6dAvaP4d2LNWOYSyI7HdqQ/viewform) and also [Advanced Apps fund](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVaUlkx6iwI8Q6lDaB-Er1lkCKqiogt8nDCVL9I66XY98RbA/viewform)
* Read [Web Engines Hackfest 2022 notes - HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@tchevalier/HyoJsT4K5)
  * Amazing to see more events coming back, but also this one had passed me by in previous years so it was great to get some visibility of it (and also the copious notes). I'm always amazed about the intersection of where the web and browsers meet - in this case the [Enterprise Web](../entry/enterprise-web) and the [Hardware Web](../entry/hardware-web) as two examples.
* Made [Web Developer Events](../entry/web-developer-events) to collate links to event resources that I read about.
* Read [Community: Component Libraries: Open Web Components](https://open-wc.org/guides/community/component-libraries/) about [Web Components](../entry/web-components)
  * There are lots of people building component libraries and I'm unsure about why I don't see more information. For example, Alaska Airlines has a component library: [Auro Design System | Alaska Airlines | Seattle, WA](https://auro.alaskaair.com/#gsc.tab=0,) ING bank too [GitHub - ing-bank/lion: Fundamental white label web component features for your design system.](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion) :mind-blown:
