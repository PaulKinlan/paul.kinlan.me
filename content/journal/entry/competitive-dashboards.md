* Competitive Dashboards help provide an objective way (although have the potential to be editorialised) of letting developers and ops teams compare different products to see if they meet a bar set out by the author. It can also be an incentive for products and projects on the dashboard to implement critical missing features or meet performance targets... if the dashboard has enough visibility in the ecosystem.
  * CrUX Technology Report [Core Web Vitals Technology Report (cwvtech.report)](https://datastudio.google.com/c/u/0/reporting/55bc8fad-44c2-4280-aa0b-5f3f0cd3d2be/page/M6ZPC)
    * This is an Ã¼ber dashboard that lets you compare different technologies and their impact on performance... and more.
    * Updated every month with the latest data from [HTTP Archive](../../entry/http-archive)
  * Build tools [Overview | Tooling.Report](https://tooling.report)
    * No longer updated.
  * Images [Images | Tooling.Report](https://images.tooling.report)
  * TLS [Is TLS Fast Yet?](https://istlsfastyet.com/)
    * From 2014 and used to help show that the perception that TLS for HTTP connections is slow, and it's safe (from a business perspective) to move.
  * Web Components: [Custom Elements Everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/)
    * Created by [Rob Dodson](../../entry/rob-dodson) the goal was to highlight that Web Components can be used everywhere.
  * [Is Houdini Ready Yet?](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/)
    * Made to give developers confidence that they can use the new rendering technology. In this case it's clear that Houdini is not ready yet. Updated in 2021 by [Surma](../../entry/surma) so the report is out of date.
  * [Are we distributed yet?](https://arewedistributedyet.com/)
  * [Firefox Performance Dashboard](https://arewefastyet.com/win10/benchmarks/overview?numDays=60)

* Best patterns and practices for creating a competitive dashboard
  * The dashboard is only as useful as the last update, if it's no longer updated it's inaccurate and shouldn't be relied on - unless the "is X ready yet" shows "X is ready".
  * Try not to be the owner of the tool/product/goal and use it to downplay the work of others. The goal is to be as objective and as critical as possible so that developers can trust the output.
  * More coming soon.
