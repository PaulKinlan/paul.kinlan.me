  * Don't disagree.

  * Great web site built by a part of the Chrome team that explains media a little more and has some interactive demos integrated in.
* Read [Style scoping versus shadow DOM: which is fastest? | Read the Tea Leaves](https://nolanlawson.com/2022/06/22/style-scoping-versus-shadow-dom-which-is-fastest/)

    * > Moreover, an important characteristic of CRDTs is that they support decentralised operation: they do not assume the use of a single server, so they can be used in peer-to-peer networks and other decentralised settings. In this regard CRDTs differ from the algorithms used by Google Docs, Trello, and Figma, which require all communication between users to flow via a server.
