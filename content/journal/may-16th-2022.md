* Currently struggling with some CSS animations for an 'air-horner' clone.
  * Read [animation-timing-function - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function)
    * I hadn't realised that there are a number of new properties 'jump'
  * Read [Jumps: The New Steps() in Web Animation](https://danielcwilson.com/blog/2019/02/step-and-jump/)
* Reflecting on Google IO Developer perspective
  * There's was a major over-arching theme of "[Developer Productivity](../entry/developer-productivity)" and " [Better Together](../entry/better-together) "
  * Chrome
    * We focused a lot on a theme of what we called "stability" (or [Platform Stability](../entry/platform-stability)) as much as possible. That is try and focus on making sure that developers know what they can rely on vs what is more experimental. We still have the experimental work but it's more clearly labelled.
    * [Web Capability](../entry/web-capability)
      * How people have done it today (e.g, Photoshop)
      * What will really help you in the future (but is not quite ready yet)
        * e.g, [Federated Credential Manager](../entry/federated-credential-manager), Page Transitions
    * [Web Quality](../entry/web-quality)
      * Performance, Performance, Performance
      * Design
* I created a simple little demo web app and I needed to find an online audio editor and an image editor. It's hard to find good Web Apps.
  * [Image Editing](../entry/image-editing) I used [Photopea | Online Photo Editor](https://www.photopea.com/)
  * [Audio Editing](../entry/audio-editing)
    * It's a mess and really hard to find good web apps here. There are some interesting web apps, but they're not the same as Audacity. Turns out there is an [Audacity online](https://www.offidocs.com/newfilemanager01.php) which is kinda cool. The problem is it launches like an entire office suite which I didn't need, and I couldn't tell if it was [WASM](../entry/wasm) ported or if it was a VNC-like experience.
  * [Regular Expressions](../entry/regular-expressions)
    * [regex101: build, test, and debug regex](https://regex101.com/) - my favourite.
* Read [Flexibly Centering an Element with Side-Aligned Content](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/04/26/flexibly-centering-an-element-with-side-aligned-content/)
* Researching [Open Props: sub-atomic styles](https://open-props.style)
  * Love this, so many great simple styles that I can just use.
  * Updated blog to at least use the color of the site. The grey has a nice blueish slate.
  * I realise now that I need a lot of help to make my site look and read half decent.
    * I should spend time on [Learn Responsive Design](https://web.dev/learn/design)
* Exploring [logseq](../entry/logseq)
  * [isomorphic-git Â· A pure JavaScript implementation of git for node and browsers!](https://isomorphic-git.org/)
  * [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/)
* Read [StorageManager.persist() - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StorageManager/persist)
  * Apparently `persist` is supported in Safari... what are the details across all browsers? I know that Chrome has some funky heuristics
* Private Storage
  * When I first tried [logseq](../entry/logseq) I used the website, and it was spectacular. You could open up a local folder and use that as your data store and it would never leave your device (in theory). I do wonder if there is a story about web apps only connecting to your local device and storing data there.
    * Is there a CSP policy that would not allow post requests (even to the origin?)
    * What is the state of this across browsers?
    * I realised I don't know how `File` object works, does it load the entire file in to memory? Is that why we need [Storage Foundation](../entry/storage-foundation) API?
