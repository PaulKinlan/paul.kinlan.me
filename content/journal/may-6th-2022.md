* Read [Slightly Random Interface Thoughts](https://bkardell.com/blog/OnInterfaces.html) by [Brian Kardell](../entry/brian-kardell)
  * "Wow - 1997 was a quarter of a century ago" - Loved this idea that when we look back to a quarter of a century ago from a quarter of a century prior what changed and look at how much things have changed. Everything and nothing.
  * It made me wonder about AR and VR - maybe my time has passed. I'm more comfortable in technology augmenting and improve some experiences ... heck, I'm sitting in the [British Airways](../entry/british-airways) lounge right now getting [Coffee](../entry/coffee) delivered to me by pointing my phone at a URL. I'm not a complete luddite but I do wonder if I will be considered one.
* Read [Responsible JavaScript](../entry/responsible-javascript) by [Jeremy Wagner](../entry/jeremy-wagner)
  * Read this on the plane and it was a throughly good and compact read. Lot's of great advice.
* TODO Research https://github.com/yjs/yjs
