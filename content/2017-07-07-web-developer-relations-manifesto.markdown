title: "Web and Chrome Developer Relations manifesto"
description: "How should Web and Chrome Developer Relations work?"
---

This might seem a little odd, but I would love feedback from the web development
community about how you see the web and how you see [my Web and Chrome Developer
Relations](https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev) team working.

What is below is almost straight from a doc I was writing that describes our
high level goals as a team. My worry is that it could be quite hyperbolic, but
it is something I would like to see all web developer relations team be held
to in the long term.

This isn't set in stone but I would like to start a discussion around this. I
would appreciate as much feedback as possible. Are we missing anything? Are we
not focusing on the correct problems? What would you do?

> Goal of this doc: A public and open statement about our goals and priorities 
> and how we intend to work with and for developers. A Manifesto for Web Developer 
> Relations, if you will.

The web is for everyone. The medium of the web has such an incredible reach with 
an incredibly low friction to access and no single owner making it the most open 
platform in the history of the world enabling anyone anywhere to publish content 
and consume information and experiences. 

Our goal is to help developers build for this open platform and meet the needs 
of their users and to make the world's information and experiences universally 
accessible.

We advocate for an open web on behalf of the Chrome team and users of the web 
and we will support the ecosystem to reach these broad goals irrespective of the 
browser, the tools or platforms that developers and their users prefer. We will 
support this goal by creating the supporting guidance and tooling that they need 
to be successful.

We prefer working in the open and we strive to help developers achieve their 
goals with as much transparency as possible, by working with developers 
directly.

We will advocate for developers and using feedback from the developer community 
we will help steer Chrome and our contributions to the web platform.

We believe that the web is for everyone and developers need to focus on the 
principles of Accessibility, Speed, Security, Simplicity and Capability for the 
long term health of the web. 

### Accessibility 

_The web has incredible reach and that means that anyone and everyone should be 
able to use it irrespective of capability._

We will work to ensure that developers understand why they should build 
accessible sites and how they can build them. We will work to ensure that 
developers have all the tools they need to simplify the process of creating 
accessible experiences.

### Speed

_The web's strength is the ability to access content, apps and games with a 
single tap of a link. People should not be penalised because their devices or 
connectivity are more constrained than the developer's._

We want the web to be usable instantly on every visit to a page and be useable 
even in the presence of unstable connectivity. We want experiences to be smooth 
and engaging and most of all we want those experiences to be respectful of the 
users constraints be it battery, performance, connectivity or associated costs.

We will work to ensure that there are clear goals and targets for all developers 
to aim for, that the tools and libraries that developers use are fast by default 
and that the reason for reaching these goals is rational and well understood.

### Security and Privacy

_The web is a user hostile medium. Users should be able to trust the sites that 
the engage without the fear of tracking, monitoring or active attack._

We want users to remain secure in the presence of an adverse network between the 
user and the services that they consume. 

We will help developers build secure sites and software through best practice 
guidance and tooling.

### Simplicity

_The web is the simplest and most effective means to reach people, yet it can 
seem overly complex to build for._

We want to enable and promote the reach of the platform whilst keeping the web 
simple to build upon. We want to also make new powerful capabilities of the web 
platform simple for developers to adopt.

We will explain the platform from the ground up by creating best practice 
guidance and tooling, we will work with library creators and we will support 
framework authors and their ecosystems.

### Capability

_The web is a viable alternative to native platforms, yet the levels of support 
across browsers and devices make it hard for this to be a reality._

We want experiences to be able to accessible to everyone and not locked away
inside an app or other closed platforms. We want users and developers to
understand what the web can do and how they can deliver the rich experiences
their users desire in the medium of their choice. 

We will create the tooling and guidance needed for developers to be able to take
advantage of the latest additions to the platform in a way that is respectful of
the capabilities of the users devices and capabilities of other browsers. It's
not a race to match native, developers will be able to clearly see a path to 
integrating leading edge technology in a way that is good for their users and
their themselves.

That's it I think. I would very much appreciate your thoughts and feedback.
