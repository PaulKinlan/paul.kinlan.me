summary: eBay has introduced a free API access program called the Unified Pricing
  Scheme. This is a significant change that opens up opportunities for developers,
  like myself, who were previously hesitant to use the API due to usage fees.  This
  new scheme enables thousands of developers to experiment with the eBay API without
  cost.

title: EBay Offering Free API Usage

---
Just a quick note, finally Ebay are offering what appears to be free calls to their API system. They call it the Unified Procing Scheme and can be found at <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/roadmap/2005-Q1/unified-schema#documentContent">http://developer.ebay.com/roadmap/2005-Q1/unified-schema#documentContent</a>.<p />This is great news, I have been yamering on in the past that I would not be using it whilst there is a charge to use it.  I know I am not going to change the world, nor am I going to make Ebay Trillions of dollars.  But I suspect there are thousands of people like me who would like to experiment with the API.<p />
