I have not had a lot of time to update this blog recently.  I have been working on a couple of side projects.  One of which is one I hope to get released this week.  Another is a .Net hosted site to host examples that I do on this blog.<p />The .Net hosted site is behind schedule and probably won't see the light of day for another couple of weeks, but I aim to use it as a guide to help people use .Net 2.0 and ASP.Net 2.0 (as well as helping myself learn more about it).  I intend to host controls that I create on there too and maybe some simple tutorials.<p />I will let you know about the former project soon.  But be aware I have fallen for the FIELDSET tag in HTML, I don't know how I lived without it!!! :)<p />
