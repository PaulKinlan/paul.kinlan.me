summary: I've been busy with side projects lately, so the blog has been quiet. One
  project should be released this week.  Another is a .Net 2.0/ASP.Net 2.0 hosted
  site for examples from this blog (and to help me learn .Net). It's behind schedule,
  but will eventually host controls, tutorials, etc. More info soon on the first project.
  And, btw, the FIELDSET tag is awesome!

I have not had a lot of time to update this blog recently.  I have been working on a couple of side projects.  One of which is one I hope to get released this week.  Another is a .Net hosted site to host examples that I do on this blog.<p />The .Net hosted site is behind schedule and probably won't see the light of day for another couple of weeks, but I aim to use it as a guide to help people use .Net 2.0 and ASP.Net 2.0 (as well as helping myself learn more about it).  I intend to host controls that I create on there too and maybe some simple tutorials.<p />I will let you know about the former project soon.  But be aware I have fallen for the FIELDSET tag in HTML, I don't know how I lived without it!!! :)<p />
