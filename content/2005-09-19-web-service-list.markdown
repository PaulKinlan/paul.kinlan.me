I seem to be always complaining that there are no good references/directories to companies who offer web services.  I finally found one <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis">http://www.programmableweb.com/apis</a>.  It is a pretty decent list of some major API's on the Web.  It does however, highlight the pitiful lack of companies offering decent API's to developers.<p />
