summary: I've always struggled to find good directories of companies offering web
  services.  I finally stumbled upon ProgrammableWeb (http://www.programmableweb.com/apis),
  which has a pretty good list of major web APIs. However, it also highlights the
  disappointing scarcity of companies providing decent APIs for developers.

I seem to be always complaining that there are no good references/directories to companies who offer web services.  I finally found one <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis">http://www.programmableweb.com/apis</a>.  It is a pretty decent list of some major API's on the Web.  It does however, highlight the pitiful lack of companies offering decent API's to developers.<p />
