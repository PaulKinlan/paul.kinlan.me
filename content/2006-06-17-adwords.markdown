I have invested in some Adwords Advertising campaigns, for this site and also my <a href="http://www.Topicala.com">http://www.Topicala.com</a>.  I will let you know how they get on but for now they are bringing an extra 60 visitors each to both sites on average a day [which I can afford :)]<p />I am still in the early stages and I have been playing around with differnt things to see how they work, but I have tuned off adverts in googles search results because they were costing too much.<p />I managed to get 600,000 advert impressions the other day for my kinlan.co.uk domain, but I cannot tell what keywords they are hitting and on what sites they are displayed.  The Click though rate was quite low though.<p />If anyone has some good "Marketing ideas" let me know.<p />If you came to this site via an adsense advert let me know what you thought of the advert and of my site. [<a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a>].  Also if you could tell me the site you came from that would be brilliant.<p />I am thinking of highlighting specific posts I make with adverts on the google network.  It seems likea good way to get people directly to posts I want them to see on my site.<p />
