summary: TRACK is a musical and visual journey built with WebGL and WebVR. It features
  an evolving abstract environment made from procedurally generated geometric shapes,
  offering a unique experience with every viewing.  It's built with Houdini and Three.js,
  and I highly recommend checking it out!

title: TRACK | A WebGL Experiment by Little Workshop

> This project is a musical experience built with WebGL and WebVR.
> 
> Inspired by the music track, we created an ever-changing environment composed of various geometrical shapes. These were generated procedurally in Houdini and exported to Three.js.
> 
> All visual elements are randomized differently on each viewing.
