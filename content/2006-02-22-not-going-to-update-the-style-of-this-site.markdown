summary: I've been considering updating the website's design as mentioned before,
  but haven't found one that is both simple and aesthetically pleasing.  I may update
  it in the future when I have more time.

title: Not going to update the style of this site

I was thinking about it, like I said in my previous post, but I have still couldn't think of a design that I really really liked, something really simple but wouldn't make people go "ick".<p />Ah well, if I get time I will update the style :)<p />
