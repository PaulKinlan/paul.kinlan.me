title: I am still not happy with the style of this site
published: true

I go through fazes, I really like the look of my site, then it hits me.... Really, the style of my site is rubbish. I am going to have to change it again, the only problem is that I don't really get much time at all.<p />Anyway, at least I have come up with a potential logo for the site, (when the new design kicks in). I thought I would mess around with some vector graphic programs and see what I can come up with.<p />[[posterous-content:raeEoezxoCoFCEyIkGpw]]<p />What do you think?<p />UPDATE:  If you are reading this entry now, I am a lot happier with the site.
