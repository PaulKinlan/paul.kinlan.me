It's my 10 year anniversary at Google today, and I've had an incredible time. I've been able to work on Chrome for the entire time here, starting as the most junior member to be being able to run a great team of passionate Developer Advocates, Developer Programs Engineers, Tech Writers, Program Managers and Developer Marketers all whose goal is to focus on helping make web development easier and better (sometimes with a Chrome focus, most of the time an holistic focus of Cross browsers).

I'm also on a flight to San Francisco for our team summit where we will cover the next few years ahead, but I've got some time to reflect (and procrastinate building the presentation for the team). I was also reading [Jason Snell's feedback about Apple](https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/01/apple-in-2019-the-six-colors-report-card/) and Developer Relations is mentioned in it, and it got me thinking.

Improving [Developer Satisfaction](/thinking-about-developer-satisfaction-and-web-developers/) will be a major focus for us this year, but what do you think we could be doing more of? what could we doing less off? In an ideal world what would you like a Web Developer relations team to be doing? How can we help you and your teams even more?

Looking forward to hearing your opinions especially if there are broad strokes that I can think about that could inform a strategy, I'm also slightly apprehensive :)
