summary: Celebrating my 10th anniversary at Google working on Chrome and leading a
  Developer Relations team.  As we plan for the next few years, I'm reflecting on
  how we can improve Developer Satisfaction.  Inspired by recent feedback on Apple's
  developer relations, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on what a web browser developer
  relations team should prioritize. What can we do more of? Less of?  How can we best
  support you and your team? Share your opinions, especially broad strategic ideas.

title: What do you want from a Web Browser Developer Relations team?

---

It's my 10 year anniversary at Google today, and I've had an incredible time. I've been able to work on Chrome for the entire time here, starting as the most junior member to be being able to run a great team of passionate Developer Advocates, Developer Programs Engineers, Tech Writers, Program Managers and Developer Marketers all whose goal is to focus on helping make web development easier and better (sometimes with a Chrome focus, most of the time an holistic focus of Cross browsers).

I'm also on a flight to San Francisco for our team summit where we will cover the next few years ahead, but I've got some time to reflect (and procrastinate building the presentation for the team). I was also reading [Jason Snell's feedback about Apple](https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/01/apple-in-2019-the-six-colors-report-card/) and Developer Relations is mentioned in it, and it got me thinking.

Improving [Developer Satisfaction](/thinking-about-developer-satisfaction-and-web-developers/) will be a major focus for us this year, but what do you think we could be doing more of? what could we doing less off? In an ideal world what would you like a Web Developer relations team to be doing? How can we help you and your teams even more?

Looking forward to hearing your opinions especially if there are broad strokes that I can think about that could inform a strategy, I'm also slightly apprehensive :)
