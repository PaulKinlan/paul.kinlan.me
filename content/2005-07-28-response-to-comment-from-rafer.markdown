summary: Thanks to Scott Rafer for the comment!  I'm experimenting with providing
  topic search results rather than keyword searches to offer broader perspectives
  on a topic.  RSS feeds are there because I like staying up-to-date, sort of like
  a personalized PubSub.  I'm open to change though, so I'll experiment with adding
  color-coded boxes at the bottom of each post linking to Technorati tags, Feedster,
  and MSN Search results, all related to the post's topic to avoid tag spam.

title: Response to Comment From Rafer

---
I am pretty chuffed I have had a comment from one more person that I don't know :) Yay.  Normally it is just my colleagues or friends who post.  This one I think was from Scott Rafer from Feedster.<p />Anyway to respond to the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/07/futher-experimentation.html#c112250075238991987">comment</a>.  Currently I kind of like the Topic search.  I am yet to experiment with keyword search of blog content (although I do link to MSN Search).<p />I chose topic searches because I think that way I might be able to provide people with a more general list of related links on the complete topic as a whole and not just any blog that contains the word/words that I choose to search for.<p />I provide the RSS feeds, because I am keen on the process of keeping up to date with certain topics.  A feed will alert me to this information.  It's kind of like PubSub (I think) but I provide you with the feed topics.<p />However, I might simply be doing the wrong thing.  There is no harm in experimenting :).<p />I think what I might do is provide a little section at the bottom of each post rather than the links to content.  I will provide a colour coded box for each type of link.  Technorati tags might be listed in a blue box, Feedster in a red and MSN searches in green perhaps. (The next post will contain this as an experiment).  I don't want to be accused of Tag Spam, so they will only be related to the post.<p />
