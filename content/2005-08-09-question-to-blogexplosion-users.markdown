summary: I'm curious if my BlogExplosion traffic is genuinely interested in my content.
  If you found my blog through BlogExplosion, would you still visit if you'd discovered
  it elsewhere? If not, I'd love to understand why.  Your feedback helps me determine
  if my content resonates with readers or if it's simply unread traffic. Email me
  your thoughts!

title: Question to BlogExplosion Users

---
This is a quick question to any of the visitors from BlogExlosion.<p />If you came across this site from anywhere other than Blog Explosion would you keep visiting?  If not, why not?<p />I am just trying to work out if the extra traffic it generates is from people who are interested in the topics I talk about.  Or if it the content is not read.<p />If you feel like answering drop me an email (<a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a>) I would be grateful.<p />Thanks<p />
