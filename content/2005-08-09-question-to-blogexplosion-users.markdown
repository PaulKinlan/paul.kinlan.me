This is a quick question to any of the visitors from BlogExlosion.<p />If you came across this site from anywhere other than Blog Explosion would you keep visiting?  If not, why not?<p />I am just trying to work out if the extra traffic it generates is from people who are interested in the topics I talk about.  Or if it the content is not read.<p />If you feel like answering drop me an email (<a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a>) I would be grateful.<p />Thanks<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
