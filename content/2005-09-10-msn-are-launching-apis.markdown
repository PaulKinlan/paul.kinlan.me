Yes! Yes! Yes!<p />MSN are launching API's that enable developers to access their search results accoriding to the <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/index.php?p=2178">Search Engine Journal</a> which quotes an article by the <a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050909-072415">Search Engine Watch</a>.  Basically if you go to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/</a> you see a holder page which tells us to come back on Tuesday 13th of September.<p />Expect me to investigate them and talk about them here and on <a href="http://tagger.kinlan.co.uk">http://tagger.kinlan.co.uk</a>.  I just hope they do something innovative like Yahoo's related searches, Contextual searches and Term Extraction and not just provide access to their search results [which would still be cool though].<p />
