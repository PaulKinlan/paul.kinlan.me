summary: MSN is launching APIs on Tuesday, September 13th, allowing developers to
  access their search results.  More information will be available on the MSN developer
  site.  I plan to explore these APIs and discuss my findings on this blog and on
  tagger.kinlan.co.uk.  I hope they offer innovative features beyond basic search
  result access, similar to Yahoo's related searches, contextual searches, and term
  extraction.

title: MSN are launching APIs

Yes! Yes! Yes!<p />MSN are launching API's that enable developers to access their search results accoriding to the [Search Engine Journal](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/index.php?p=2178) which quotes an article by the [Search Engine Watch](http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050909-072415).  Basically if you go to [http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/) you see a holder page which tells us to come back on Tuesday 13th of September.<p />Expect me to investigate them and talk about them here and on [http://tagger.kinlan.co.uk](http://tagger.kinlan.co.uk).  I just hope they do something innovative like Yahoo's related searches, Contextual searches and Term Extraction and not just provide access to their search results [which would still be cool though].<p />
