summary: My site, DeliTag, is being flagged as suspicious by IE7, likely due to the
  username and password fields for Delicious.  I've created a privacy statement to
  address concerns about how this information is used. In short, the credentials are
  passed directly to Delicious without any further processing. The transmission is
  unsecured, mirroring Delicious's own security.  The privacy statement at [http://www.kinlan.co.uk/Deli/DeliPrivacy.htm](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/Deli/DeliPrivacy.htm)
  offers more details. Please contact me with any questions.

title: My Site and The Anti-Phishing Feature

---
Ever since I have created DeliTag and put it on the main page I have had IE7 say that my page is a suspicous site.  I think it is because I ask for a username and password, unless someone has reported me for something.  Anyway, if you were wondering what I do with the Del.icio.us username and password that you put in I have created a Privacy statement for you to read.  In summary, all I do is pass on your username and password as a normal web request to Del.icio.us.  It is unsecured, but so is Del.icio.us so there is nothing I can do about it.  I do not do any other work with it.  The only other data that is processed is my website content, which belongs to me (therfore I take the inherent usage and privacy limitations that Yahoo infer when using their Webservices)<p />The Privacy Statement is at [http://www.kinlan.co.uk/Deli/DeliPrivacy.htm](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/Deli/DeliPrivacy.htm) which describes it better.
