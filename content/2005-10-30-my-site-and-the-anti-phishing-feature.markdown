Ever since I have created DeliTag and put it on the main page I have had IE7 say that my page is a suspicous site.  I think it is because I ask for a username and password, unless someone has reported me for something.  Anyway, if you were wondering what I do with the Del.icio.us username and password that you put in I have created a Privacy statement for you to read.  In summary, all I do is pass on your username and password as a normal web request to Del.icio.us.  It is unsecured, but so is Del.icio.us so there is nothing I can do about it.  I do not do any other work with it.  The only other data that is processed is my website content, which belongs to me (therfore I take the inherent usage and privacy limitations that Yahoo infer when using their Webservices)<p />The Privacy Statement is at <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/Deli/DeliPrivacy.htm">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/Deli/DeliPrivacy.htm</a> which describes it better.  If you have any comments let me know: <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a> or leave a comment.<p />
