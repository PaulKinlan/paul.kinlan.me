I have just jumped on to the Sphere Beta Program.  I think it is okay but here are some basic feedback points:<p /><p>I like the related Blogs more than I like the Blog post results.  That is when I search for "AJAX" the posts that it brings back don't really interest me, but the blogs about AJAX do. I am not too sure that I can find what I want with a search [in blog posts at least] off just a couple of keywords.  I don't know why! Maybe it is me<p />Things that I would like to see</p><ul>
<li>RSS subscription of results </li>
<li>Results from - to ranges.  Not just "in the last 4 months" I would like "not before 2 months ago" and "no later than 4 months"; that type of thing. </li>
<li>A search that says "find blogs post like this one" etc.</li>
</ul>
