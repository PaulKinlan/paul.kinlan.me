summary: I've joined the Sphere Beta Program and have some initial thoughts. While
  I find the related blogs feature useful, the blog post search results for keywords
  like \"AJAX\" aren't quite hitting the mark. I'd love to see improvements such as
  RSS subscription options for results, more refined date filtering (e.g., between
  specific dates), and a \"find similar posts\" feature.

I have just jumped on to the Sphere Beta Program.  I think it is okay but here are some basic feedback points:<p /><p>I like the related Blogs more than I like the Blog post results.  That is when I search for "AJAX" the posts that it brings back don't really interest me, but the blogs about AJAX do. I am not too sure that I can find what I want with a search [in blog posts at least] off just a couple of keywords.  I don't know why! Maybe it is me<p />Things that I would like to see</p><ul>
<li>RSS subscription of results </li>
<li>Results from - to ranges.  Not just "in the last 4 months" I would like "not before 2 months ago" and "no later than 4 months"; that type of thing. </li>
<li>A search that says "find blogs post like this one" etc.</li>
</ul>
