title: Just Looking at my Logs
published: true
---
I use AWStats for my log analysis, which is the one my host provider uses.  I was looking at the logs for the visitors who have accessed my site via a Search Engine.<p />Currently this month, Google is at 4 and so is MSN.  Yahoo is nowhere to be seen.  Anyway, I noticed one of the searches was for "does blogging make money".  This got me thinking,  I'll type this in on Google and MSN (I can't tell which search came from which search engine).  I couldn't find my page with in the first 15 pages of results on both search engines.  I went through each page of results and got bored looking for me.<p />If you are that person email me: <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a> and tell me how you found me :)<p />I can answer the question "does blogging make money".  Well for me, No it doesn't ;)<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
