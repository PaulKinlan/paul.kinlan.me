summary: I stumbled upon a helpful link about colour theory, which explains how to
  combine colours effectively.  I'm fascinated by this concept and plan to research
  it further. Currently, my colour theory knowledge is limited to using shades of
  the same colour, such as SteelBlue and LightSteelBlue. I'll explore Google and Wikipedia
  for more information.  I've bookmarked the link, despite my Favorites in IE7 crashing.

I can"t recall how I came accross <a href="http://www.rominteq.com/c_the.html">this</a> link but it is really handy.  It basically describes how colors should be combined so that they are pleasing to the eye.  I never actually knew that this type of stuff existed.  I am going to do a bit of reading about this because I found it quite interesting.<p />My limit of understanding about colour theory (Color Theory for anyone outside the UK) is to use shades of the same colour.  So, SteelBlue will contrast well with LightSteelBlue.<p />I will have a bit of a Google for more information.  I have a feeling that this will all be on Wikipedia too.<p />I have added it too my Favorites, I don"t know why though.  (My Favorites in IE7 crash everytime I try to view them)<p />
