I can"t recall how I came accross <a href="http://www.rominteq.com/c_the.html">this</a> link but it is really handy.  It basically describes how colors should be combined so that they are pleasing to the eye.  I never actually knew that this type of stuff existed.  I am going to do a bit of reading about this because I found it quite interesting.<p />My limit of understanding about colour theory (Color Theory for anyone outside the UK) is to use shades of the same colour.  So, SteelBlue will contrast well with LightSteelBlue.<p />I will have a bit of a Google for more information.  I have a feeling that this will all be on Wikipedia too.<p />I have added it too my Favorites, I don"t know why though.  (My Favorites in IE7 crash everytime I try to view them)<p />
