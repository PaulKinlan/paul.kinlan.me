summary: I'm still confused about OPML.  I know it's for sharing blog subscriptions,
  but I don't see the practical benefit for me or my readers.  Even after checking
  resources and looking for OPML enthusiasts like Robert Scoble and Dave Winer, I'm
  still lost.  Technorati's Blog Finder wasn't much help either.  Wikipedia had the
  best explanation, but I still need to figure out how to actually *use* OPML.

title: OPML. Nope I still don't get it

In an earlier post I talked about promising to include an OPML list of the blogs I read in the page. Seriously, [is this all](http://feeds.scripting.com/whatIsOpml#usingOpmlToExchangeSubscriptionLists) that it does? I just don't get what OPML is supposed to help me do or to how it helps anyone who reads my blog.<p />Here is a list of all the people ("Web Celebs") who like OPML and must know what to use it for; If anyone of them could tell me I would be very greatful. [I am trying to find more people]<p />Robert Scoble;Dave Winner;<p />Hmm, I really do think I am missing something. Should I be using OPML to help me find people who are OPMLing and know what it is for?<p /><strong>All I am trying to say is that I don't know what I am supposed to do with it!</strong><p />ps. I tried to use Technorati's Blog Finder to find OPML supporting Blogs, there where 4 I think. Way to go Technorati!<p />pps. If your like me. The best resource I found was over on Wikipedi [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML)].<p />
