It's gut wrenching to see whats going on over at Twitter. I've got friends who work there, friends who are no longer there, and there's nothing I can do to help other than offer a supporting ear or share any opportunities that I find with them.

When I wrote about some of my [journey](https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/10/paul-kinlan-shares-his-passion-for-web-development-and-devfest.html) to where I am today, a large part of the path that I took, I took with Twitter. The opportunity to connect with nearly anyone and also find a place for my own voice was one of the reasons why I got to work on what I work on now. I made a lot of friends. I connected with people that I would never have met if it wasn't for Twitter. People helped me, and I hope I got to support and raise people up.

The people on Twitter made Twitter what it is, and it's changing in a way that I don't like and I have no ability to influence. On reflection it changed constantly over the years, slowly it seemed, but now it's all of a sudden.

Since the earliest times on the site we all wondered at how it would actually make money and survive, and we are asking that more than ever.

I supported it with content. I didn't pay for it. It doesn't owe me anything, but I feel that I owe it and the community a lot.
