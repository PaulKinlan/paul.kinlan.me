title: A Minor Problem with my AJAX Application

It appears that my sample AJAX Application  (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag.html">here</a>).  Has some minor security issues.  This is a similar problem to the problems I have in Firefox, cross site data access. <p />The work around for this is simple in IE6 and IE7 (although not preferable).  If you go to  "Internet Options -&gt; Security -&gt; Custom Level"  and select the option under "Miscellaneous" select "Enable" in the "Access data sources across domains" section.<p />See the image.<p />[[posterous-content:egxxvEEmirocsdiukCcG]]<p />
