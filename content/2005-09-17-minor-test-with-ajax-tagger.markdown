I have just been fiddling with the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">AJAX Tagger</a>.  Based on my previous entry about <a href="http://tagger.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/use-of-wikipedia-articles-instead.html">Wikipedia Integration</a> I have now added support for generating links directly to related Wikipedia articles.<p />The results are shown below which are for this article if that makes sense.  They were created in about a minute and I think they are all pretty relevant.<p />One of the things that I have noticed is that sometimes the URL isn't the direct url to wikipedia, sometimes it is the ClickUrl in the Yahoo search results.  I am not too sure why this happens, but I will let you know if I make any progress on this.<p />I just need to think about ordering on them.<p />How would you like to see your tags and related documents ordered?  Email me <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a> or leave a comment.<p />
