summary: I've been experimenting with the AJAX Tagger and integrated it with Wikipedia
  to generate related article links.  It's pretty quick, generating relevant links
  in about a minute.  There's a minor issue where sometimes the links point to Yahoo
  search results instead of directly to Wikipedia, which I'm investigating.  I'm also
  looking for feedback on how to order the tags and related documents, so feel free
  to email me or leave a comment.

title: Minor Test with AJAX Tagger

---
I have just been fiddling with the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">AJAX Tagger</a>.  Based on my previous entry about <a href="http://tagger.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/use-of-wikipedia-articles-instead.html">Wikipedia Integration</a> I have now added support for generating links directly to related Wikipedia articles.<p />The results are shown below which are for this article if that makes sense.  They were created in about a minute and I think they are all pretty relevant.<p />One of the things that I have noticed is that sometimes the URL isn't the direct url to wikipedia, sometimes it is the ClickUrl in the Yahoo search results.  I am not too sure why this happens, but I will let you know if I make any progress on this.<p />I just need to think about ordering on them.<p />How would you like to see your tags and related documents ordered?
