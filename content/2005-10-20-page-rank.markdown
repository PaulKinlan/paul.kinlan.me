A lot of people out there are talking about Page Rank and the iminent page rank up date.  I can't say that I am really bothered I have never had any and I doubt I ever will.  Does it really matter that much?  Email me or leave a comment if you know about it.<p />I personally think it is a placebo that make people think that they understand google's system, when in acutal fact it has relativly little meaning anywhere.<p />Maybe I am wrong though!<p />
