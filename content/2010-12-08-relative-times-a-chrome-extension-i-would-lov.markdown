summary: I'd love a Chrome Extension that converts times and dates to my local timezone.
  It gets confusing seeing times like 12pm PST when it's actually 8pm where I am.  A
  simple conversion would be incredibly helpful!

title: Relative times. A Chrome Extension I would love to see

---
I was walking back from the train station, it is late at night, well it is now very early morning, but you can't tell that from my post time... Well maybe you can. But anyway it gave me an idea for a Chrome Extension that I would love to see, but I don't have the time myself to create. <p /> I would love a Chrome Extension that detected dates and times in a web page and converted them into the Timezone I am currently in. So, for instance an event is time stamped 12pm PST, well that is 8pm where I am. Just a subtle change will really help. <p /> As the Meerkat says: "Simples"
