summary: I've migrated my Hugo blog's editor to Editor.js.  It's a block-based editor,
  unlike classic editors, offering more flexibility and a Medium-like experience.
  Although I faced some challenges adapting the ES5 code from the NPM distribution
  (compared to the ES Modules examples), building the UI was relatively straightforward.
  Check out Editor.js for more details.

I've updated by Hugo based editor to try and use EditorJS as, well, the editor for the blog.

> Workspace in classic editors is made of a single contenteditable element, used to create different HTML markups. Editor.js workspace consists of separate Blocks: paragraphs, headings, images, lists, quotes, etc. Each of them is an independent contenteditable element (or more complex structure) provided by Plugin and united by Editor's Core.

I think it works.

I struggled a little bit with the codebase, the examples all use ES Modules, however the NPM dist
is all output in IIFE ES5 code. But once I got over that hurdle it has been quite easy to
build a UI that looks a bit more like medium.
