summary: I've updated DeliTag to support uploading tags to SIMPY and Shadows. SIMPY
  works great!  I had some initial trouble creating a Shadows account due to CAPTCHA
  issues, but I eventually got an account confirmation email, even though I haven't
  successfully completed CAPTCHA verification yet.

title: DeliTag Now Does SIMPY and SHADOWS

---
I have updated the DeliTag to also upload tags to SIMPY and Shadows. Simpy is great Shadows won't let me get past the CAPTCHA stage. Come on guys sort it out, I want to use your service.<p /><strong>Update: </strong>DeliTag can post to Shadows, but I couldn't create an account due to a problem with CAPTCHA.  I should have made that clearer in the post.<p /><strong>Update 2:</strong>  I have created a shadows account.  I still didn't get past the CAPTCHA Verifcation, but I got a confirmation email.<p />
