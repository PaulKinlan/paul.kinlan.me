Yes!!!!<p />The previous blog entry was created with "Kinlans Automatic Tag Generator".... I say Kinlans, I am using Yahoo!'s Web service. (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com">http://developer.yahoo.com</a>).<p />I am pretty darn chuffed! The next entry should include a link to the Ajax app.  Trust me, it looks naff but it works for me.  I need to do some more experimentation with this stuff, especially the Yahoo searching as well as Technorati Integration.  <p />But other than that it is pretty cool.  Should I include the tags in this post..... Yeah go on I hear you say :)  The masses have spoken (well 6 are in the mass) :)<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
