title: My Drafts

---

I've been thinking about a lot about the state of modern web development and I wanted a place to note ideas, and then over time build up them in a way that is a little more open that me just dumping them into a Google Doc and forgetting about them.

This page is the list of ideas that I've had. There are likely many old drafts dating back many years.

These documents are completely un-developed and are a snapshot of my thoughts at the time. They will be refined over time with research, education and conversations with people in the industry, and in some cases I might delete it.

There are many errors in each of these articles, including and not limited to: spelling, grammatical, ecosystem awareness understanding and plain ignorance.

If you see something you like, don't like, then @ me (paulkinlan@google.com, @paul_kinlan) - I won't be offended.

Ideas (Note: this list will always be up to date):
