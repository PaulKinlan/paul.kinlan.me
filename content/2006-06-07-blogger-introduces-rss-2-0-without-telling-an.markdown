title: Blogger Introduces RSS 2.0 Without telling anyone it seems
published: true

I was seeing reports across the internet that that Blogger has now introduced RSS 2.0 support in to the blogs that they host.  Seeing that I use blogger but host on my own server account I thought I would check it out.  Sure enough IE7 has detected the new RSS feed but it looks like I have a mess of feeds that I need to tidy up!   Back to the template.<p />Anyway, thanks Blogger for warning us!!!!
