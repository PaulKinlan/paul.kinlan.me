summary: I've started a new blog dedicated to book reviews using WordPress! Check
  it out at http://books.kinlan.co.uk.  I'm quite impressed with WordPress's flexibility
  and plugin options, a definite upgrade from Blogger.  I'm still working on some
  features, like automatically directing users to the correct Amazon site based on
  their location, but feedback is welcome!

I have been experimenting with WordPress and rather than break this blog I have created a new Blog at <a href="http://books.kinlan.co.uk">http://books.kinlan.co.uk</a>.  Basically the blog is there to test Word Press and also put my book reviews on their with the hope of providing a service and also maybe giving me a small small referal revenue.<p />WordPress is very very very smart.  I really like it.  Much more so than Blogger!  For one you get alot more control over the blog if needed.  And the amount of pluggins for it are amazing!<p />Anyway, keep checking out <a href="http://books.kinlan.co.uk">http://books.kinlan.co.uk</a> and let me know what you think when you see it.  I still have some more things to sort out on it such as determining the country the user comes from so that I can provide the correct Amazon URL.<p />
