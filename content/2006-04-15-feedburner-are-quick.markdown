No more than 10 minutes or so after I posted about not having full text in my feed burner feed I got this response:<br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Hi Paul,We currently have a limit to the size of source feeds we process of<br />256k. Perhaps going full text might have put your feed over the limit.You can<br />reduce the number of posts in your feed or the text for each post to get back<br />within the limit. This will ensure we and other consumers of your feed process<br />it correctly. Hope this helps but feel free to post on our forums or email<br />anytime.Thanks,Jessie ChavezFeedburner Team </blockquote><br />Talk about monitoring public feedback.<p />Great work guys!<p />
