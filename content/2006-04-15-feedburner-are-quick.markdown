No more than 10 minutes or so after I posted about not having full text in my feed burner feed I got this response:<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Hi Paul,We currently have a limit to the size of source feeds we process of256k. Perhaps going full text might have put your feed over the limit.You canreduce the number of posts in your feed or the text for each post to get backwithin the limit. This will ensure we and other consumers of your feed processit correctly. Hope this helps but feel free to post on our forums or emailanytime.Thanks,Jessie ChavezFeedburner Team </blockquote>Talk about monitoring public feedback.<p />Great work guys!<p />
