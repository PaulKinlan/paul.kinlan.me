Robert Scoble talks about how Developer API's are changing the face of retailing. I think I briefly talked about this a while back now (Are there any good web services out there: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/04/are-there-any-good-web-services-out.html">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/04/are-there-any-good-web-services-out.html</a>).<p />I personally think if a retailer isn't planning to create API's that enable applications to be built on top of their product catalogue, ordering systems etc, then they are losing out on a massively huge potential future audience. I can't really justify it more than that, other than it is what I belief will happen.<p />So I think I agree with Roberts statement, just not really that it is going to change quickly.  For reasons below.<p />One stumbling block for me to start to use API's like EBay's is that most of the ones I find charge per call.  As a Full-time developer, after hours home developer; I can't afford to start using these services to see if I can start to do something "Entrepreneurial".  <p />Additionally, I find it hard to find companies that offer API's to their data, everyone seems so, how should I say it, keeping their cards tight against their chest.<p />Am I missing the point here?  I mean afterall Amazon provide access to their content (if only they would allow me to list Market Place Items through the same Interface) for free.  It's a revenue generator to provide open access to an API.<p />Has Ebay changed there per call billing policy?  I am finding it hard to read their site, something has gone awry with the layout.<p />Does anyone know of any cool retail web services (possibly in the UK).<p />
