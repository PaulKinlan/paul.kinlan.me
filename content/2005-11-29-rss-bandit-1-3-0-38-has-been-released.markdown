summary: I've just upgraded to RSS Bandit 1.3.0.38 and I'm really pleased with it.  This
  version successfully imported Robert Scoble's huge OPML file, has a refreshed UI,
  and seems to load large numbers of posts much faster (maybe due to disabling XSLT
  formatting).

title: RSS Bandit 1.3.0.38 has been Released

A new version of <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org">RSS bandit</a> has been released.  I like it and use the previous version all the time.  What I like about this version is that it seems to correctly import Robert Scobles opml file [Which is massive].  Also the UI has been updated [Which is nice].  I have also noticed that it seems to display massive directories of posts a lot more quickly too.  But that might be because I turned off the XSLT formatting of the aggregates.<p />
