A new version of <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org">RSS bandit</a> has been released.  I like it and use the previous version all the time.  What I like about this version is that it seems to correctly import Robert Scobles opml file [Which is massive].  Also the UI has been updated [Which is nice].  I have also noticed that it seems to display massive directories of posts a lot more quickly too.  But that might be because I turned off the XSLT formatting of the aggregates.<p />
