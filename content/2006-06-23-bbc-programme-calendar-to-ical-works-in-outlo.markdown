title: BBC Programme Calendar to iCal Works in Outlook 2007
published: true
---
<span><p>A little while ago, I created a mini mash up that used the BBCâ€™s programme API to find programs with a specific keyword in and then convert that data into an iCal file.<br /></p>
<p>I thought it would be a good test to see if Outlook 2007 can import the date from the mash-up.  The good news is that it can, and it is easy to do.<br /></p>
<p>Simply go to your account settings menu, and then click on the internet calendars tab, click "new" and then enter the URL for the programme timetable that you want to see.
