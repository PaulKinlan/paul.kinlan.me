summary: I'm building a tag directory separate from my main content. This approach
  aims to enhance indexing and provide a centralized, dynamic display, similar to
  Technorati.  It allows me to tag my directories and offers a new way to present
  related information.  Check it out and let me know what features you'd like to see!

title: My Very own Tag Directory

---
I am creating my very own tag directory.  Rather than include all the information related to a post here on this entry, I am thinking of putting the data on a seperate page.<p />It will allow the data to get indexed better, but will also mimic Technorati in a way, I will be able to tag my own directories and also provide a central, dynamic place for my data to be displayed.<p />Have fun and try it out and let me know what else you would like to see. [they are in the related tags]<p />
