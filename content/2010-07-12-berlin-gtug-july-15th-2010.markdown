summary: I'm excited to announce I'll be speaking at the Berlin GTUG on July 15th,
  2010, about building HTML-based applications.  The talk will explore the differences
  between web pages and true applications, with plenty of examples.  This will be
  my first time in Berlin, and although my visit is short, I'm looking forward to
  it!  Slides and photos to follow.

If all goes well and my flight arrives on time I will be doing a talk at the Berlin GTUG (<a href="http://www.berlin-gtug.org/2010/06/july-2010-berlin-gtug-meeting.html">http://www.berlin-gtug.org/2010/06/july-2010-berlin-gtug-meeting.html</a>) about building HTML based Applications.<p /><div>The talk should be about 45 minutes or a little less and will cover what makes an app an app rather than a web page. Â There should be some good examples in there too.<p /><div>I have never been to Berlin before, so I am really excited even though I will only be there for 1 night (and arriving at 4pm)</div> <p /><div>I will post the slides after I have finished and any photos (I hope to get lots :))</div></div>
