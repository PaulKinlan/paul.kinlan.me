summary: I'm heading to Amsterdam for a business trip, my first time back since I
  was about 7 years old.  While I'm there for work, I'm hoping to explore the city
  in my free time over the next two days and capture some of the experience through
  photos. I'd love to hear recommendations on things to see and do!

I am just about to visit Amsterdam on a business trip. The last time I went to Amsterdam was when I was 7 (I think). I remember really enjoying it then, granted I was 7 and I loved trams, but I am really looking forward to visiting it again. <p /> What would people recommend to do if I have any free time over the next two days? <p /> I plan in taking a couple of photos so I can at least try and document some of this trip.
