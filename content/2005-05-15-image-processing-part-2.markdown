summary: In this second part of my series on image processing, I'm exploring the Tiger
  Imaging Library for C#, a cool resource with complete source code and various image
  manipulation filters.  I'm considering expanding its capabilities by creating new
  filters like the fish eye effect described by Jason Waltman.  I'm also planning
  further research and experimentation with Tiger Imaging.

There is a really cool (At least I think it is) Image Processing Library (Tiger Imaging) for C# <a href="http://www.thecodeproject.com/cs/media/Image_Processing_Lab.asp/tag" rel="tag" target="_blank">here</a> (Code Project). It comes with complete source code and provides some really cool filters that enable you to perform a bit of image manipluation easily. It is by a guy called <a href="http://www.thecodeproject.com/script/profile/whos_who.asp?id=1181072"><strong>Andrew Kirillov</strong></a> and he has another article on the code project here where he demonstrates <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cs/media/Motion_Detection.asp#xx1098757xx" target="_blank">Montion Capture</a> using his library.<p />I am just wondering if I should create some filters (such as <a href="http://www.jasonwaltman.com/thesis/filter-fisheye.html" target="_blank">fish eye</a> that <a href="http://www.jasonwaltman.com/" target="_blank">Jason Waltman</a> describes). I have some plans for doing a bit of research with Tiger Imaging....
