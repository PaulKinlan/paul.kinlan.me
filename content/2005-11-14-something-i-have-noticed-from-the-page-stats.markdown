I have noticed a lot of people are trying to go to the AJAX Tagger go to AJAXTag23, this page was a test an has never worked with it.  I will have to update the URL soom because it should be AJAXTag2 that people go to ( <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2</a> )<p />
