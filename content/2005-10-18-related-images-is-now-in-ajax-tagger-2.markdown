summary: I've just released version 2 of AJAX Tagger, and it now includes a Related
  Images feature! It pulls images from Flickr that you can easily insert into your
  blog posts. While it works great, be aware that downloading many images might be
  slow in Internet Explorer due to its concurrent request limit. I believe this is
  a fantastic addition and can significantly boost traffic to your blog, especially
  considering images are known to attract readers.

Related Images is now in [AJAX Tagger version 2](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2).  The Images are pulled back from Flickr and will be able to be included in the post that the user is creating.  It works pretty well, other than the fact all the images might be slow to download with IE's limit on the number of concurrently open requests.<p />I think it is a pretty darn cool feature.  Especially when it is one of the things that can help [get people to your blog](http://www.blogginghelp.com/2005/10/17/generating-traffic/)<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Use pictures. They draw the eye. Look on Flickr or Google Images. Take what is Creative Commons, but be liberal with your link of thanks. Ask when unsure. </blockquote><p />
