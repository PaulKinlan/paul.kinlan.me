summary: I'm searching for social bookmarking services similar to Del.icio.us for
  integration with my AJAX-based DeliTag.  This would allow uploading tags to multiple
  services simultaneously.  So far, I've found Shadows, Simpy, Del.icio.us, and BlinkList
  (though the latter seems to be down).  Any other suggestions are welcome!

I have found a couple more thanks to this site: [http://www.momathome.com/](http://www.momathome.com/viewfromhome/2005/10/social_bookmarking_simple_just.php).<p />There is Shadows, Simpy, Del.icio.us and BlinkList [although the latters site is not working].  Are there any more?<blockquote>
