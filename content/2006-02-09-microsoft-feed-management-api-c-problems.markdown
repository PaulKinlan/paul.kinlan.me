I am trying to use the Microsoft Feed Management API in IE7 Beta 2 and I am trying to hook up the a feed watcher event to see when the counts of items in a feed change.<p />However, I can't get past the following line:<br />FeedFolderWatcher fwc = new FeedFolderWatcherClass();<p />I get the exception:<br />Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {281001ED-7765-4CB0-84AF-E9B387AF01FF} failed due to the following error: 80040154<p />Which from what I can tell the CLSID is not installed on my system.<p />What can I do?  Is this an install problem or a problem with the MFM API?<br />Does anybody have the full screen saver c# example so that I can see what is going on?<p />
