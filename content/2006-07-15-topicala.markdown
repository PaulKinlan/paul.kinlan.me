A little while ago I launched Topicala.com.  Topicala basically was an extension of my tag directory but it was not specific to my site.  I have been thinking over the last couple of weeks (whilst I have been unable to keep topicala up to date) that I might as well make it distributable, i.e that anyone could run the software.  So that is what I am going to do.<p />I will release the code shortly, once I have re-deployed it under the kinaln.co.uk domain.  And I will make it maintainable and modfiable so that any person can have something similar to <a href="http://www.topicala.com">www.topicala.com</a> underneath their own site.<p />Let me know if you are interested.
