summary: 'The MSN Search API is now available.  I haven''t explored it fully yet,
  but here are some useful links: Why MSN Search?, the MSN Search API download, the
  SOAP service description, and the developer registration form (requires a .Net Passport).
  The API appears to be a SOAP service, so I''ll likely need to create a proxy for
  direct calls.  The download includes documentation and sample projects. You''ll
  need an application ID, similar to Yahoo''s.  If you know how to use SOAP with JavaScript,
  please email me!'

The MSN Search API's are up. Yay!<p />I have not had much time to look at it just yet, but I have some links for you.<p />Why MSN Search? [http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/msnsearch/whysearch/](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/msnsearch/whysearch/)MSN Search API Download: [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C271309B-02DE-42A7-B23E-E19F68667197&amp;displaylang=en](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C271309B-02DE-42A7-B23E-E19F68667197&amp;displaylang=en)<p />As far as I can tell the search API is a SOA0P service [[http://soap.search.msn.com/webservices.asmx?wsdl](http://soap.search.msn.com/webservices.asmx?wsdl)], so no direct calls from IE it seems, and it looks like I will have to create a proxy forwarding kit :) ala My yahoo ones. :)<p />The download includes some documentation and some sample projects and you have to obtain an application ID which appears to be like the Yahoo Application ID.  The forms can be found here: [http://search.msn.com/developer](http://search.msn.com/developer) and it looks like you need a .Net Passport.<p />If anyone knows how to consume SOAP in JavaScript let me know.
