summary: I'm developing Ajax Tagger 2.0 and need ideas for displaying related blogs
  within the application and its output.  I'm also searching for a good search engine
  (besides Technorati and Google) to find related blogs and feeds.  Any suggestions?
  Please email me or leave a comment.

title: Suggestions for finding related blogs

I am trying to think how to display related blogs in my <a href="http://ajaxtag.kinlan.co.uk">Ajax Tagger 2.0</a> and in the resulting HTML that comes from the selection made in the application.  It is one of the remaining parts of the application that are still todo.<p />Does Anybody have any ideas?<p />I am also trying to find a good search engine that will give me a list of related blogs and associated feeds.  So far I have Technorati and Google,  Does anybody know of any other good ones?<p />Email me or leave a comment :)<p />
