summary: In this follow-up post, I've decided to use Mercurial for my project's version
  control.  While feedback leaned towards Subversion (SVN), I prefer Mercurial due
  to its distributed nature, Codeplex support, available .Net tools, and superior
  branching capabilities.  I'm open to further discussion and any compelling arguments
  for reconsidering SVN.

So, after some thought, some replies (mostly favouring SVN) I have chosen to go with Mercurial as the VCS for the project that I am working on.<p /><div>The reason being, is that although I won&#39;t be hosting on Codeplex, they support Mercurial and there are plenty of tools that .Net developers can use to bind to the SCM and the fact that it is a distribute system means it wins in my eyes. Â I will need decent branching support and I have never been a fan of SVN&#39;s branching mechanism.</div> <p /><div>I am willing to be educated more if you have any compelling reasons for me not to go with Subversion.</div>
