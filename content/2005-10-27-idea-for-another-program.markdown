A Del.icio.us automatic tag creating application.  It will work a similar way to my Ajax Tagging Application by generating topical tags based off the content of the HTML page.  Relevant topical tags can be selected and then used to upload the URL and the related tags to Del.icio.us.<p />I think it would be handy, how about you?<p />
