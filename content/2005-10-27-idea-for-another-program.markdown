summary: 'I have a new program idea: an automatic tag creator for Del.icio.us, similar
  to my Ajax Tagging Application. It would analyze a webpage''s content to suggest
  relevant topical tags, which you could then select and use to upload the URL and
  tags to Del.icio.us.  I believe this would be a useful tool. What are your thoughts?'

title: Idea for another Program

---
A Del.icio.us automatic tag creating application.  It will work a similar way to my Ajax Tagging Application by generating topical tags based off the content of the HTML page.  Relevant topical tags can be selected and then used to upload the URL and the related tags to Del.icio.us.<p />I think it would be handy, how about you?<p />
