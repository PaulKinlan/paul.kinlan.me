summary: I just cancelled my Xbox Live account after 3 months of not using it, mainly
  due to a poor internet connection with Wanadoo. The cancellation process was quick
  and easy, taking about 2 minutes.  I might consider subscribing again when the Xbox
  360 comes out.

title: Just Cancelled my XBox Live Account

---
I have just cancelled my XBox live account.  I hadn't used it for 3 months, partly because my connection was so poor [not an XBox thing, it was our Wanadoo account].  Let me just say, it was cancelled in about 2 minutes.  No messing.  I don't know if I should be happy, they didn't offer me a couple of months free or anything ;)<p />Maybe when the XBox 360 arrives I might plum for it again.<p />
