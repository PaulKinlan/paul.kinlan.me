title: Just Cancelled my XBox Live Account
published: true
---
I have just cancelled my XBox live account.  I hadn't used it for 3 months, partly because my connection was so poor [not an XBox thing, it was our Wanadoo account].  Let me just say, it was cancelled in about 2 minutes.  No messing.  I don't know if I should be happy, they didn't offer me a couple of months free or anything ;)<p />Maybe when the XBox 360 arrives I might plum for it again.<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
