summary: I'm about to hit 100 posts!  I also realized I forgot to post my Perl request
  forwarding scripts as promised, so I'll do that tonight.  I'll also start discussing
  the issues with my first AJAX application.

title: Comming up to a round number

I am coming up to one hundred posts on my site now.  Yay!<p />Anyway, I have noticed that I said I would post my Perl request forwarding on my website and then I realised that I haven't done it yet. <p />So my task for tonight is to put my Perl scripts up online, and start talking about all the things wrong with my first AJAX application.
