I have updated this entry at (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/update-about-ie7-feeds-not-working.html">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/update-about-ie7-feeds-not-working.html</a>) after to speaking to the RSS Product manager at Microsoft.  Seeing as this is my most popular post, I would appreciate it if you take a quick look at the link.  Thanks.<p />Original Post<br />This is the blog entry of feeds that don't work with IE7.  That is feeds that don't display in the IE7 Feed viewer.  When I say don't display, I actually mean that they don't render in the new format that IE7 supports.<p />I would like to know what is special about these blogs to cause them not to render correctly.<p /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/rss.aspx">IE7 Blog</a><br /><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/rss.aspx">Microsoft Developer Relations: Channel 9</a><br /><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/rss.xml">Scobles blog [Excellent Blog]</a><br /><a href="http://www.2rss.com/atom2rss.php?atom=http://www.kinlan.co.uk/atom.xml" type="application/rss+xml">Paul Kinlan [My Blog, converted automaically by 2rss.com]</a><p />Anymore?
