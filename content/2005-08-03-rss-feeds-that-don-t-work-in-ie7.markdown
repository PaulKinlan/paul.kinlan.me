summary: This post lists RSS feeds that aren't displaying correctly in the IE7 feed
  viewer.  Specifically, they don't render in IE7's new format. I'm trying to understand
  why these feeds aren't working, and I've provided links to a few examples, including
  the IE7 blog, Channel 9, Scoble's blog, and my own blog. I've since updated this
  post with more information after speaking with Microsoft's RSS Product Manager (see
  the link at the top).

I have updated this entry at (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/update-about-ie7-feeds-not-working.html">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/update-about-ie7-feeds-not-working.html</a>) after to speaking to the RSS Product manager at Microsoft.  Seeing as this is my most popular post, I would appreciate it if you take a quick look at the link.  Thanks.<p />Original PostThis is the blog entry of feeds that don't work with IE7.  That is feeds that don't display in the IE7 Feed viewer.  When I say don't display, I actually mean that they don't render in the new format that IE7 supports.<p />I would like to know what is special about these blogs to cause them not to render correctly.<p /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/rss.aspx">IE7 Blog</a><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/rss.aspx">Microsoft Developer Relations: Channel 9</a><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/rss.xml">Scobles blog [Excellent Blog]</a><a href="http://www.2rss.com/atom2rss.php?atom=http://www.kinlan.co.uk/atom.xml" type="application/rss+xml">Paul Kinlan [My Blog, converted automaically by 2rss.com]</a><p />Anymore?
