title: 'Bookmarklet: Eyedropper'

I was reading Stefan Judis's awesome "[Web Weekly](https://webweekly.email/)" and in [this weeks post](https://www.stefanjudis.com/blog/web-weekly-100/) he mentioned the `EyeDropper` API in [Chromium Desktop browsers only](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EyeDropper/open#browser_compatibility) - I totally missed this and because I frequently have to grab color information for slide design I need something quick to hand. Bookmarklets are quick to hand, so I built one for you.

```JavaScript
const e = new EyeDropper();
e.open().then(d => {
  alert(d.sRGBHex);
}).catch(console.error)
```

EyeDropper <â€” Just drag this to your bookmark bar.
