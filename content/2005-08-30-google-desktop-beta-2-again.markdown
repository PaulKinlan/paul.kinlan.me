summary: I uninstalled Google Desktop Search Beta 2 because it was slowing down my
  computer.  I kept the search index, though, just in case I decide to reinstall it
  later.  My computer's speed is back to normal now.

Just thought I would say that I have removed Google Desktop Search Beta 2 from my machine. (<span style="font-size: 78%;"><em>But I kept the index - just in case</em></span>)<p />My machine now runs back at normal speed, yeeehaaa!<p />Ah well, you live and learn.<p />
