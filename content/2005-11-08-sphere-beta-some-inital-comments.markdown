summary: I've just started testing the Sphere Beta Program. While I appreciate the
  related blogs feature, I find the blog post search results less helpful.  When I
  search for terms like \"AJAX\", the related blogs are more relevant than the actual
  posts returned.  I'm not sure keyword searches within blog posts are effective for
  me.  I'd love to see features like RSS subscriptions for results, customizable date
  ranges (e.g., between 2 and 4 months ago), and a \"find similar blog posts\" search
  option.

I have just jumped on to the Sphere Beta Program.  I think it is okay but here are some basic feedback points:<p />I like the related Blogs more than I like the Blog post results.  That is when I search for "AJAX" the posts that it brings back don't really interest me, but the blogs about AJAX do. I am not too sure that I can find what I want with a search [in blog posts at least] off just a couple of keywords.  I don't know why! Maybe it is me<p />Things that I would like to see<ul>
<li>RSS subscription of results </li>
<li>Results from - to ranges.  Not just "in the last 4 months" I would like "not before 2 months ago" and "no later than 4 months"; that type of thing. </li>
<li>A search that says "find blogs post like this one" etc.</li>
</ul>
