<p>Just a quick note or two about my previous post. </p><ol>
<li>It no longer animates like the Animated Gel Button</li>
<li>The GelButton idea was actually modified code from the same site as I mentioned, however it was a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DesignersLovenet?m=28">different page</a>.<p />
</li>
</ol><p />
