If you are impacted by any of the layoffs at Google or across the industry, please reach out and I will try and help in any way that I can.

I am happy to make connections and intros, LinkedIn recommendations, resume review, interview prep, a listening ear.  
  
For over a year now [I've been running calls](https://paul.kinlan.me/helping-you-book-a-meeting/) and I want to try and help you all as much as I can. My calendar is [open](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUJEeUlKOUdneGdnfGRlZmF1bHR8ZTFmZmIyZGJkZmIwMmU0ZTNiMDAwZDYzZjYyNWMxYjQ), please use me in anyway that you think I might be able to help.
