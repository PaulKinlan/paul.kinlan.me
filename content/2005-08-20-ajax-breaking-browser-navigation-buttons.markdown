title: AJAX Breaking Browser Navigation Buttons
published: true
---
I read a lot of people are complaining that AJAX applications are breaking the Navigation of the Web Browsers.  I am sure most of these people also say that "Web Browser" Backward  Forward navigation is wrong anyway.  I kinda like the idea that if I am in an AJAX based application I will get out of the application completly by just pressing the back button.<p />Its not AJAX that breaks the navigation.  Its the applications that break the navigation.  Its the applications that break the Bookmarking.<p />Google Maps seem to have sorted the bookmarking issue out.  But you have to remember that some applications don't lend themselves to Web Style Navigation, some applications don't lend themselves to bookmarks.<p />More on this later after I have thought some more on the subject.<p />Have you any comments, leave me one or email me: <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a><p />
