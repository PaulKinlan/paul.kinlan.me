I have just discovered that to be listed in Technorati's Blog Search you have to configure your claim and then add 20 keywords that relate to tags.  These tags don't even have to be on your blog.<p />Why on earth is it done this way.  They have a list of all the tags that a blog uses and all the journals that cross reference each other, so why can't they use this information instead of stepping back 5 years in search technology.<p />Ah well.<p />
