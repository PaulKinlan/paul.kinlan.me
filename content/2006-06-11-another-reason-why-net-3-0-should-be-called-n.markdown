title: Another reason why .Net 3.0 should be called .Net 2.5 (or something similar)
published: true

Check out Kirk Allen Evan's blog entry (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kaevans/archive/2006/06/11/626299.aspx)">http://blogs.msdn.com/kaevans/archive/2006/06/11/626299.aspx)</a> . All through it, his reasons given point to calling it something less than .Net 3.0 IMHO. <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Again, note that .NET Framework 3.0 is an additive release to .NET Framework 2.0. With .NET Framework 3.0, the languages still use the 2.0 compilers, and leverage the 2.0.50727 Framework.</blockquote>It is based on 2.0 for everything so why not keep with that!!!  The version number really doesn't make anything clear!<p />
