summary: This post agrees with Kirk Allen Evans's argument that .NET 3.0 should be
  named something closer to 2.5 due to its reliance on the 2.0 framework and compilers.  The
  additive nature of the release doesn't warrant a full version number increment.

title: Another reason why .Net 3.0 should be called .Net 2.5 (or something similar)

---
Check out Kirk Allen Evan's blog entry (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kaevans/archive/2006/06/11/626299.aspx)">http://blogs.msdn.com/kaevans/archive/2006/06/11/626299.aspx)</a> . All through it, his reasons given point to calling it something less than .Net 3.0 IMHO. <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Again, note that .NET Framework 3.0 is an additive release to .NET Framework 2.0. With .NET Framework 3.0, the languages still use the 2.0 compilers, and leverage the 2.0.50727 Framework.</blockquote>It is based on 2.0 for everything so why not keep with that!!!  The version number really doesn't make anything clear!<p />
