I just saw:

I thought this was incredibly interesting.  There is something to be said for
this. It is something that I have been thinking about for a while as we think
about web apps, and having users find them.

I have spoke to a number of colleagues about this, some of them have worked in
very successful businesses where the discovery problem was a real problem and
creating something successful is normally a combination of the following:

*  You need to market your app or site and you need to spend real money. 
*  You need to be in the places where users are (i.e, the marketplace) 
*  You need to be able to convert a user. This could be from a visitor to a user, or convert to a payment etc.

I think the phrasing is wrong when we talk about discovery, we look at it in
terms of keywords, or top 10 lists,  or category buckets and SEO. We should be
thinking about matching user intent and the marketplaces that can match that
user intent. I suspect it is one of the reasons why search advertising works
well and converts well:  you know the user is searching for a flight,
advertise them a flight.

When you think about matching intent it becomes a lot clearer in my mind,
people want a good, yet fair system of indexing and ranking based on the
intent of the user. Assuming good intentions, a discovery engine (search, or
whatever) will automatically rank results based on a set of heuristics to give
you a list of items that it thinks matches the users intent in order of
quality or applicability.

When I worked on Web Intents, for every action that the user wanted to perform
(such as share link) we could  either fulfil it directly from their list of
installed apps, or you could query the market (Chrome Web Store in this case)
and because we knew the user&#39;s intent (I need to edit an image) we could, if
the market had the goods, fulfil it.

This got me thinking about the marketing part, and in my head I am in two
spaces (I am pretty sure there are many more types, and what I am talking
about might have a proper name, but this is what I am thinking):

*  Intent based marketing, 
*  Blunt marketing

Intent based marketing comes when you are in marketplace and the index matches
the intent of the user,  your marketing is to effectively try and be more
prominent than the natural ranking of what ever the marketplace uses. In the
case of Web Intents, I could have quite easily envisaged a market where Adobe
would pay to get  their new App into the top of the application picker,
because they directly knew the user wanted to "edit an image".

Blunt marketing is for everything outside of that marketplace. I see on mobile
a lot today where the marketplace is ill-matched to the users&#39; intent.  And
whilst mobile advertising seems to be generating a lot of revenue at the
moment, it mostly involves advertising apps  from within apps, or on TV etc.

I think app store search is broken and doesn&#39;t match the results of the index
well with the user&#39;s intent, which is  why we see such a huge market for Blunt
marketing.  Good apps don&#39;t get found by users as well as they should be,  so
successful apps will normally have a heavy marketing budget behind them.

I have no data (yay!), but I suspect Intent based discovery is a lot more
effective and will provide more value  for people who want "discovery" AND
people who have budget to market. Is Blunt marketing bad? No, but in many
cases it shows the failure of the marketplace (and the ability for natural
discovery of quality).

How does this apply to web apps?  The discovery problem is not going to go
away any time soon until we can match the user&#39;s intent in a search, or
action, and fulfil that request with apps on the web. We don&#39;t really have a
marketplace, or the goods to sell in that marketplace... yet.
