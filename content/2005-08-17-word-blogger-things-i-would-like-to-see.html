title: Word Blogger, Things I would like to see
published: true
---
<p>I have been playing with the Blogger Tool for Windows, and there are some features that I would like to see go into future versions: </p><ol>
<li>The ability to edit the HTML before uploading to the Blogger.</li>
<li>The ability to add Images</li>
<li>The ability to add Tables</li>
<li>The ability to add Select styles to text that is based on a style that I define</li>
<li>Correctly create Ordered Lists and Unordered list.  Currently all lists are un-ordered</li>
<li>If I provide a shading for an element, I would like it be applied to the element in the HTML</li>
</ol><p>This tool is way off from being "feature" complete, but it is a good start.  I probably won't be using it too much because I like having the control over what goes into a post.  I might use it to "Save as Draft" and then edit it later.  I can get through loads of text without having to worry about my Tagging system or other styling stuff.</p><p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
