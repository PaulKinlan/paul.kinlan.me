<p>I have been seeing a lot of weird posts in blogs recently.  That go along the lines:</p> <p>Temporary Post Used For Style Detection (d21..............) </p> <p>The only reason why this appears must be because Windows Live writer puts it in their so that it can display the "in style" editing for your blog posts.  It makes sense I suppose when you think about it.</p> <p>But it is only there for minutes and Google Blog Search picked it up.  So I suppose it shows how fast Google is indexing Blogs if anything! :)</p>
