title: 'Hiring: Chrome Privacy Sandbox Developer Advocate'

---

It's looking like 2020 will be a big year for Privacy across the web and [our team (Chrome) is no exception](https://blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/).

[Chrome has a rather large number of projects](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox) that are coming in the following years that will continue to improve the privacy of all users on the web and we need the help of an awesome [Developer Advocate](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/141138306499781318-developer-advocate-chrome-privacy/) to ensure that the entire cross-browser privacy story is heard, understood and implemented across the web.

The Developer Advocate role will help to accelerate the adoption of security and privacy related primitives from all browsers (think about all the great work browsers like Firefox, Safari, Brave etc are doing) across the web ecosystem and to make sure that our engineering and product teams are prioritising the needs of users and developers. It's not going to be easy, because a lot of these changes impact the way developers build sites today; for example, the [Same-Site](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/) change that is landing in Chrome imminently requires developers of widgets and anything that is hosted on a 3rd party origin meant to be used in a 1st party context, to declare that the correct `SameSite` attribute, lest they be automatically set to `SameSite=Lax`, which will restrict their usage slightly.

There's going to be a lot of work to do, so being able to work with companies, frameworks and libraries in the ecosystem is going to be a key part of this role.
