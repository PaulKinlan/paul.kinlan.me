summary: I'm looking for user feedback on the next version of the AJAX Tagger.  Specifically,
  I'd like to know if users would prefer to have the option of placing Technorati
  tags inline with the blog post content, or if they prefer the current method of
  listing them at the end.  Inline placement could be problematic because the Yahoo
  Term Extraction API sometimes uses phrases not found in the post itself.

title: AJAX Tagger Question

---
I am just working on some requriements for the next version of the [AJAX Tagger](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag) application.  If any of you could get back to me then I would greatly appreciate your feedback.  Would you as a user like to be able to have the posistion of the tags configurable?  What I mean by this is would you like the option to include links to technorati tags inline with the blog entry or at the end of the article.  <p />Currently it creates a list of related tags at the end of the post.  Would it be good if they were inline with the post?  This has a minor problem, because sometimes the Yahoo Term Extraction API doesn't uses phrases and related keywords that aren't in the blog itself.<p />
