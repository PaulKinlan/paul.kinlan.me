I am just working on some requriements for the next version of the [AJAX Tagger](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag) application.  If any of you could get back to me then I would greatly appreciate your feedback.  Would you as a user like to be able to have the posistion of the tags configurable?  What I mean by this is would you like the option to include links to technorati tags inline with the blog entry or at the end of the article.  <p />Currently it creates a list of related tags at the end of the post.  Would it be good if they were inline with the post?  This has a minor problem, because sometimes the Yahoo Term Extraction API doesn't uses phrases and related keywords that aren't in the blog itself.<p />
