summary: I was listening to a BBC Radio 4 program about blogging, and a guest pointed
  out that US/European bloggers link to others more than UK bloggers.  Inspired by
  this, I'm going to upload an OPML file so people can see the feeds I read.  I'm
  starting to understand OPML's use in RSS feeds and online journals, planning to
  categorize my feeds. I'm also thinking of adding a section to my site for linking
  to interesting articles I find in those feeds, with my own comments.

title: OPML and BBC Radio 4

---
I was listening to ShopTalk, a BBC Radio 4 Broadcast the other day and the topic of conversation was about Web logs and the Blogosphere.  There was an interesting comment by one of the guest speakers [a woman whose name I can't remember].  The comment roughly went like this:  Bloggers in the US and the rest of Europe tend to link to other sites and other bloggers a lot more than UK bloggers.  [Currently there is no permalink for the current issue]<p />So being a UK Blogger, I promise that I will upload an OPML File so that you can know who I read. :)<p />I think I am starting to get the point of OPML.  Well, the basics of using it in an RSS Feed and Online Journal.  I will just be using OPML to show a list of feeds and how I have catagorised them.<p />I am also tempted to provide a part of the site where I explicitly just link to other interesting articles that I read in the feeds that I subscribe to, along with a small comment.<p />
