summary: I've created a simple Chrome extension that lets you post the current page
  to Google Buzz and see its popularity. In upcoming posts, I'll use this example
  to demonstrate how easy it is to build Chrome Extensions and add cool features,
  like using Browser Actions, the Tabs API, Cross Domain Requests, and the Context
  Menu API. Check out the extension and its code on the Chrome Web Store and Github.

<p>The other day I post a simple Chrome extension that allows you to post the
current page to Google Buzz, but also allows you to see how popular the
current page is on Buzz.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of posts, I will use this app to show you how to build
a Chrome Extension and how easy it is to add some awesome features (and also
show you how cool Google Buzz is).</p>

<p>It is pretty neat, and pretty simple to create.  It uses the following
Chrome Extension features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Browser Actions, to let you 'Buzz This',</li>
<li>Tabs API, to determine the current page you are on,</li>
<li>Cross Domain Requests to allow you to get the number of 'Buzzes' that
have been made about the current page,</li>
<li>Context Menu API to allow you to post images and links to Buzz &lt;&ndash; my
favourite feature.</li>
</ol>


<p>To get started, the extension is here:
