Blogger.com has introduced a new feature:  Trackbacks.  The only problem is, if you have't got one of their templates you can't enable it easily because there documentation is not completed see here: <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=1216" title="Blogger Uncompleted Documentation">http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=1216</a><p />Come on Blogger, when you introduce a feature can you at least have some good, completed documentation!!  <p />Other than that, at least your introducing new features :)<p />
