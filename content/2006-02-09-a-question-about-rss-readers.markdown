title: A Question about RSS Readers

Does anyone know of any RSS readers that can filter out languages?<p />That is I would like an RSS reader that will only display English RSS items [or any other language that I choose to filter by]<p />Currently I use SharpReader which implements IBlogExtension, but that is about it.  It doesn't provide an API to filter individual posts.<p />Maybe the Microsoft Feed Management API can help me out?<p />
