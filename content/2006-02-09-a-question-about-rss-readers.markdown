summary: I'm looking for an RSS reader that can filter feeds by language.  I want
  to be able to specify a language (like English) and have the reader only show me
  items in that language. My current reader, SharpReader, doesn't offer this feature.  I'm
  wondering if something like the Microsoft Feed Management API might be a solution.

title: A Question about RSS Readers

---
Does anyone know of any RSS readers that can filter out languages?<p />That is I would like an RSS reader that will only display English RSS items [or any other language that I choose to filter by]<p />Currently I use SharpReader which implements IBlogExtension, but that is about it.  It doesn't provide an API to filter individual posts.<p />Maybe the Microsoft Feed Management API can help me out?<p />
