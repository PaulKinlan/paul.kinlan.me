summary: Wow! Just realized I've been blogging for over 20 years, starting way back
  in August 2004 on kinlan.co.uk with Blogger.  The journey has taken me through Posterous
  and landed me here on paul.kinlan.me with Hugo (and maybe Jekyll at some point).  Sure,
  there's some cringe-worthy stuff in the archives, but it's *my* history.  And honestly,
  I wouldn't be where I am today without this little corner of the internet.  Huge
  thanks to Tim Berners-Lee and everyone who's made the web what it is!

I missed it, but I just realised that as of August 28th 2024 I\'ve been [blogging for over 20 year](https://paul.kinlan.me/first-post "https://paul.kinlan.me/first-post"). I would have finished university and left my startups a couple of years before, gone went in to Enterprise, left behind Linux and Perl for a brief fling with c# and .net and started to make my first steps in to being a lot more public both in terms of documenting what I do and helping other folks.

I first started out on [kinlan.co.uk](http://kinlan.co.uk "http://kinlan.co.uk") which was powered by Blogger and the FTP deploy. I had a brief foray in to posterous (I liked the idea of email publishing), and then settled at some point on [paul.kinlan.me](http://paul.kinlan.me "http://paul.kinlan.me") and Hugo (I think i also used Jekyll at some point).

Looking back through my archives, I\'ve written some really rubbish things.... I was alway terrible at spelling and grammar. But they\'re my things, and I like that.

I can also say that I wouldn\'t be doing what I do today without my little place on the Internet.

The web is my home and I hope I can help it stay everyone\'s home in the future. I\'m thankful to Sir Tim Berners-Lee for inventing this thing and all the people that have built on top of this platform to make it what it is today (warts and all).
