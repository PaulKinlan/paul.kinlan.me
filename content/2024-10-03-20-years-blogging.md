I missed it, but I just realised that as of August 28th 2024 I\'ve been [blogging for over 20 year](https://paul.kinlan.me/first-post "https://paul.kinlan.me/first-post"). I would have finished university and left my startups a couple of years before, gone went in to Enterprise, left behind Linux and Perl for a brief fling with c# and .net and started to make my first steps in to being a lot more public both in terms of documenting what I do and helping other folks.

I first started out on [kinlan.co.uk](http://kinlan.co.uk "http://kinlan.co.uk") which was powered by Blogger and the FTP deploy. I had a brief foray in to posterous (I liked the idea of email publishing), and then settled at some point on [paul.kinlan.me](http://paul.kinlan.me "http://paul.kinlan.me") and Hugo (I think i also used Jekyll at some point).

Looking back through my archives, I\'ve written some really rubbish things.... I was alway terrible at spelling and grammar. But they\'re my things, and I like that.

I can also say that I wouldn\'t be doing what I do today without my little place on the Internet.

The web is my home and I hope I can help it stay everyone\'s home in the future. I\'m thankful to Sir Tim Berners-Lee for inventing this thing and all the people that have built on top of this platform to make it what it is today (warts and all).
