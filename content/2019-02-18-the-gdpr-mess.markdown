summary: The implementation of GDPR consent across the industry is flawed and confusing.  Many
  consent mechanisms offer choices that seem meaningless, as users often can't discern
  the actual impact of their selection.  For example, the difference between accepting
  all cookies and using only necessary cookies is often unclear, both in terms of
  functionality and verifiability.

The way we (as an industry) implement GDPR consent is a mess.

I'm not sure why anyone would choose anything other than 'Use necessary cookies only', however I really can't tell the difference between either option and the trade-off of either choice, not to mention I can verify that it is only using necessary cookies only.
