summary: I noticed the Yellow Pages cover uses different font sizes, similar to a
  tag cloud, and it made me wonder if a tag cloud for business listings would be useful.  It
  also made me notice that \"Bouncy Castles\" was one of the biggest entries!

title: Tag Clouds and the Yellow Pages

---
I was looking at the cover of the new Yellow Pages (UK) this Morning that arrived at my house the other day.  I was just staring at it and I saw the wierdest thing.  A TagCloud, well what could be described as a losse Tag Cloud, obviously I have no way of knowing if the size of the words on the packaging indicate the popularity of any particular subject.  Suffice to say, Bouncy Castles are BIG! :)<p />It got me thinking though, has anyone ever done a Business Listing Tag Cloud?  Would it be worth it?<p />
