summary: I'm disappointed with Blogger BackLinks. I thought they'd automatically pull
  in links to my posts from Google Blog Search, but they don't.  Users have to manually
  add them, which isn't ideal.  I plan to create a version that automatically queries
  Google Blog Search and updates my page with backlinks from there.

title: Why I don't like Blogger BackLinks

---
I have been trying to play with [Blogger BackLinks](http://help.blogger.com/default/bin/answer.py?answer=1235&amp;topic=39), and I can say that I don't really like them.  I don't really like them because people have to use them!  I was expecting Blogger Backlinks to automatically link into the Google Blog search to find a list of all the blogs that link to my post.  And then update my page from there.<p />I think what I will do is develop a version that does use them,  it will fire a query off to Google and see what happens from there.  I mean, after all Google Blog search allows you to do this, and export the results as RSS.<p />
