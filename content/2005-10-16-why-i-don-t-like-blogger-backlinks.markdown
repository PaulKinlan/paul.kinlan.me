title: Why I don't like Blogger BackLinks
published: true
---
I have been trying to play with <a href="http://help.blogger.com/default/bin/answer.py?answer=1235&amp;topic=39">Blogger BackLinks</a>, and I can say that I don't really like them.  I don't really like them because people have to use them!  I was expecting Blogger Backlinks to automatically link into the Google Blog search to find a list of all the blogs that link to my post.  And then update my page from there.<p />I think what I will do is develop a version that does use them,  it will fire a query off to Google and see what happens from there.  I mean, after all Google Blog search allows you to do this, and export the results as RSS.<p />
