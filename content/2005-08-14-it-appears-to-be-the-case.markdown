It does seem that technorati couldn't parse the way I had done my URL's.  Saying that I definatly did them wrong.<br /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
<tr><td>Related Tags</td></tr>
<tr class="Technorati"><td>
<a href="https://paul.kinlan.me/tags/Parse" class="Tag" rel="tag">Parse</a> <a href="https://paul.kinlan.me/tags/Url" class="Tag" rel="tag">Url</a> <a href="https://paul.kinlan.me/tags/Technorati" class="Tag" rel="tag">Technorati</a>
</td></tr>
