summary: 'I love Posterous, but it''s time for my blog to move on. I''m looking to
  hire someone to migrate my blog to a new platform.  Must-haves include: static site
  generation, git integration, markdown/text/HTML support, preserving my current URLs
  and all imported posts, and full template control.  Ideally, it won''t be Ruby-based.
  I''m not concerned about hosted solutions, a fancy CMS, or comments.'

title: I am willing to pay someone to move my blog from Posterous.

Posterous has been great for me, but now it is time to move it.

I don't have the time to do this so I am very willing to pay someone a
modest fee for managing the move of my blog to a platform that meets the
following requirements:

Mandatory Requirements:
- not a hosted solution like Blogger or Tumblr
- static output (no database)
- can write posts in markdown, text or html
- all content can be managed through git.
- URL structure is kept exactly the same as now
- will keep all the posts that I imported into posterous from blogger.
- full control over templates

Nice to haves:
- preferably not a ruby based system

Not bothered about:
- any authoring or management front end.
- auto posting networks
- existing comments or future commenting systems
