I am trying to get the readership of this blog up.  Currently it is about 1 :).  Anyway, I thought that it might be wort including some more links in each of my blog posts.<p />At the end of every article I am going to put a link to a Technorati Tag RSS feed relating to the post.  Hopefully you will be able to see in a feed browser other people who are interested in the same things I am talking about.<p />
