I've spent this week in India doing more research about Web Development in
India and how mobile is changing that.  Publically at least it is not rosey,
app development and app thinking is very high whislt building for the web with
mobile in mind is very low.

I was lucky enough to get a speaking slot on an event that the local Indian
Developer Relations team had organised called "Google for Mobile India" that
was focused on taking advantage of the massive potential for Mobile in the 
country.

I focused the talk around the benefits that the web presents to developers
and how we are changing Chrome and helping to improve the web platform by 
introducing features that offer more opportunities for developers to build
instantly engaging sites and apps without the need for a mandatory app 
download.

A quick TL;DR:

1. Be Instant and Available
2. Don't lose a user by sending them to an App install, offer them a rich
   experience immediately
3. Be fast
4. Offer Richer Experiences 

I've cut out the first few slides as they are just my contact details and 
title slides.

The video is [also available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/mm5BJZUfqBo?t=22173&end=24081) and
embedded below.

{{% slide 2 "Mobile is massive" %}}

I said it years ago :).

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 3 "Mobile changes everything" %}}



{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 4  "Google recognize this." %}}

Late last year the search team started badging mobile friendly sites when they
were displayed in mobile search.  The team had found that users have a better
experience on the web when the page they were visiting worked well on mobile.

Earlier this year (2015) the search team started to down-rank sites that were not
"Mobile Friendly".

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 5 "Death of the full screen install banner?"  %}}

This example is one of the modern burdens for web user's is that there are so many things
that get in the way of complete your task one of them is fullscreen banner's to get you to 
install the app.  

Now if you have a fullscreen banner for your app then search may remove your "Mobile friendly" badge.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 6 "There is a solution: Inline app install" %}}
I had planned on taking lots of photos, but this was one of the only ones I took.

India and the way people are using phones was incredibly interesting.
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 7 "I went to India and I learnt a lot of things." %}}

The first thing is that my friends in the Bangalore office said
 "Paul, do not try and cross the road"... so I ignored them. I gave it ago
 and this is photographic proof.

I also learnt more about India and the way people are using phones and I spoke to 
a lot of businesses about what they are doing with the web and mobile. 
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 8 "Mobile is growing rapidly" %}}
There is so much potential and every year the equivalent of population of the UK 
is going mobile and for many the web means nothing because it is a very 
app centric model.  

I got a lot of feedback from businesses and developers that, well, kinda hurt :)

Established brands leverage the web, they still have a huge amount of
traffic from desktop too so they have massive presence already but
for many companies it is a now just stopping point to get on to native. 

Acquire a user on the web and push them as quickly as possible in to an app.

Why? Many reasons.
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 9 "I need my app to be installed" %}}

Users expect their app to be in all the places that you expect apps to be: In 
the app draw, in the switcher and on the homescreen.  I don't get this
from the web.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 10 "I need notifications for engagement" %}}

It is nearly impossible to engage with users on the web.  Native
gives us Notifications that drive a lot of users back into our app.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 11 "The Network is terrible in India. I need to be fast." %}}

The web can't deliver experiences reliably when we have intermittent or
no connectivity.

Or so people think...

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 12 "Give me moar capabilities" %}}

I really really need access to Geolocation and the Camera.  This is impossible 
on the web.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 13 "It comes to four basic points" %}}

1. Having an installed experience, being on the device and working irrespective 
   of connectivity
2. Deeply engaging experiences that bring users back
3. The ability to build fast
4. Access to rich capabilities

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 14 "Screw the web" %}}

The general consensus is that The Web is Dead and if you want an engaged user
you need to build an app.  I think that is incredibly wrong and short sighted.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 15 "Cannot's" %}}

We need to somehow change this Meme.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 16 "Can's" %}}

And start building amazing experiences on the web.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 17 "Lofty goals?" %}}

If you have a user on your site you should try and get them engaged and invested
with your brand straight away and not push them away into an install step.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 18 "Web all the way" %}}

My publicly stated goal is to do away with apps altogether, but I don't think 
that is going to happen anytime soon.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 19 "Paul. W.T.Flip." %}}

Now, I know that pretty much everyone in the audience is thinking that I am 
talking rubbish but I have my reasons.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 20 "I still build things." %}}

I still build products, especially if it helps me make my point.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 21 "Same goals" %}}

It's all about solving user's problems.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 22 "SLICE: The Web" %}}

[Airhorner](https://airhorner.com/) &mdash; check it out.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 23 "You have to first get users" %}}

You get users by word of mouth, advertising, search and social.  And 
ultimately it is the link that enables instant access to the content 
that is pointed to.  This allows easy distribution and sharing of content
 and functionality.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 24 "Linkable" %}}

Let's assume the user has heard of your brand and they search for it, 
what steps do they have to go through to get to use your service.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 25 "Urgh." %}}

* Load the store
* Click install
* Accept a permission
* Download it and wait
* Got to the homescreen
* Launch and use.

That is a lot of steps.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 26 "Yay. The Link." %}}

Click. *Done*.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 27 "The less a user needs to do, the better." %}}

"In a consumer mobile app, every step you make a user perform before they get value out of your app will cost your 20% of users."

This is crazy

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 28 "Now apply this hypothetically..." %}}

The blog post includes the data on the App Store, so if you apply this generally
to the App install process you can see how much impact it has.  You start with
1000 users and end up with a quarter.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 29 "Go web?" %}}
We apply the same rules and the web is by far the winner in this case.  Click
the link and start using the experience.
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 30 "Everyone knows Apps are better" %}}

Native Apps are more engaging and convert better.  User's prefer them.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 31 "262 > 800" %}}

Logic.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 32 "Why web?" %}}

Today, why would you choose the web?  One word: Reach.  The power of the web
is that experiences are one click away and there instantly.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 33 "Why the app?" %}}

Deeply engaging, installed and fast.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 34 "Deal with the devil" %}}

You end up trading the reach of the web for deeper engagement.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 35 "But..." %}}

I think this type of deal is a terrible thing.  Who is to say those 800
users won't be engaged if you gave them the chance.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 36 "I think the web can help here" %}}

If you build a site and experience correctly you can get the best of both worlds
and this is what my talk is all about.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 37 "It's all change for the web" %}}

If you build on the web you still have the reach, but now you can build
more engaging experiences.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 38 "How?" %}}

Good question.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 39 "4 simple steps" %}}

1. Focus on Performance
2. Think about installable offline enabled experiences
3. Plan for notifications and other engaging features
4. Get Service Worker into your life

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 40 "Service Worker" %}}

Better than sliced bread.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 41 "OMG. Specs are boring" %}}

Currently re-learning W3CSpec-alese by listening to Yoda. To be compliant, you MUST. Do or do not, there is no MAYBE.

These Specs are sometimes so hard to parse for developers.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 42 "A slightly better way of saying it" %}}

Service worker is a background script that sits between the browser and the OS.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 43 "Pages now have an app-like life-cycle." %}}

Pages with a Service worker now have an app-like life-cycle.  They have phases that they go through
that live beyond the page being visible in the browser.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 44 "Background FTW" %}}

This is one of the most important things: Service Workers live in the background
and can now respond to system level events even when the browser is closed.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 45 "Take up no resource" %}}

And the goal is they take up little or no resource, especially when they are a sleep
and when the way they wake up the goal is to go a sleep as quickly as possible.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 46 "Work when the browser is closed?" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 47 "It's simple to start" %}}

A page resisters a SW, and the browser loads it :)

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 48 "Service Worker Registration looks like:" %}}

3 or 4 lines of Javascript are all that's needed to get a service worker working
on your page.... OK, it's not actually doing anything, but it is being registered.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 49 "You have an install event" %}}

It's not too different from an "install" of an app, you as a developer get to choose
what you want to do, for example you could cache all the files that are needed to
run the app offline.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 50 "And you get access to a lot of system level events" %}}

Things like fetch, and handling push messages are to name just a few.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 51 "Let's look at installability" %}}

Being on the homescreen and everywhere you expect an app to be and loading instantly
irrespective of connectivity.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 52 "It roughly means two things" %}}

Being on the homescreen and everywhere you expect an app to be and loading instantly
irrespective of connectivity.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 53 "For users it means the same thing" %}}

They want their app to be on the homescreen where they can quickly launch and when 
it launches it should look and feel like an app (i.e, be in the tab switcher).

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 54 "So how do you get on the homescreen?" %}}

TL;DR - Create a manifest.  If you are a native app developer it is very similar
to the Android Manifest, it describes what to launch, how to launch it and how it
should appear on the users device.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 55 "But how do I technically get on the homescreen" %}}

* Create a manifest,
* Link to it from the page :)

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 56 "Act installed, be ephemeral" %}}

By having the install event we can cache content for later use and make it feel
like an instant experience the next time the site is launched.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 57 "The code for install" %}}

This is all the code that is needed to get airhorner.com ready for working offline.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 58 "How do you serve that cached content?" %}}

Great question.  Service Worker allows you to intercept all the requests being made from
the web page and that means you can respond to the request how you want to.  For example
you could serve data directly from your cache.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 59 "What does it look like?" %}}

It's pretty simple. Because you control the network, you can decide what to do.  In this
example you can check the local cache first and if available return it to the browser.  If the
item is not in the Cache you can go out to the network and return it to the page.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 60 "Simplest example of Offline first Service Worker" %}}

And this is the code for the previous example.

* Check the cache to see if the response is cached
* If yes, return it; If no, fetch it from the network.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 61 "2 down, 3 to go" %}}

We now have reach and installability solved, let's look at engagement.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 62 "Engagement" %}}

The art of keep the user interested in your app and providing them with the 
right information at the right time.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 63 "What does engagement mean?" %}}

Deep integrations with the OS so that your site looks like it should be part of the 
system and using Notifications to provide relevant information when the user
needs it.


{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 64 "Some of it is up to the browser" %}}

Browser vendors should be making it seamless for the user and the developer to be
able to make sure their content is integrated with the device.  A quick example
is that media elements should be able to be controlled all the hardware devices
that control media in native experiences.  For example, Media Keys and Android 
Wear controls should "just work"

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 65 "Make it look part of the system" %}}

Adding a theme colour allows you to make it look like your site is integrated more deeply into the 
system.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 66 "Most apps just go native for notifications" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 67 "You can handle push messages" %}}
Like a native app, by using Service Worker you can now handle push messages when the browser is either
open or closed.
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 68 "Push is pretty simple" %}}

If you have ever used Google Cloud Messaging service you will be very familiar with this process:

1. The user registers for a push notification
2. Your system sends a message to GCM on a timely and relevant event
3. GCM sends the message to the Android Device
4. The Android device wakes up Chrome.
5. Chrome wakes up your service worker.
6. You handle the `onpush` event


{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 69 "Handle the on push event" %}}

The code is pretty simple.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 70 "Notifications are system notifications" %}}

They appear exactly where you expect Android notifications to appear.  For example,
they will appear on your Android Wear device.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 71 "You can do clever things in 'onpush'" %}}

Because the user might not action the push message or notification until a later time
when they might not have network connectivity you can do things such as cache all
the content that is needed when you receive the push so that it is always available.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 72 "Caching in onpush is simple" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 73 "Handle notification events " %}}

Because a notification may be created when your browser is closed or it 
lives longer than your browser session, you need to handle the logic for 
notification in the service worker. 

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 74 "It's pretty easy" %}}
The user clicks the notification, the service worker wakes up and fires the
`onnotificationclick` event and then you decide what to do.
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 75 "Code for handling a notification" %}}

The event is raised and you decide what to do.  In this case it just opens a window, but
you might want to think of the logic that you will use to maybe re-use existing windows 
so that you don't annoy the user.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 76 "3 out of 5" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 77 "Focus on performance" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 78 "Using poor infrastructure is not an excuse" %}}

Many of the top sites in India take over 20 seconds to load and
when you look at the code there are many simple things that they 
are doing incorrectly that make it appear like there are problems
with the network.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 79 "Native apps will have the same problems" %}}

Ultimately if you have app that interacts with the network, either by fetching content, 
images or API responses, you are doing the same thing as the web site.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 80 "Everyone focuses on the wrong thing." %}}

Many of the businesses focused on the wrong metric, they looked at optimizing
the page load time.  Instead you need to focus on....
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 81 "Time to first render" %}}

You should be looking at the time to first render which is the point at which
something is first shown to the user... For most Indian sites this is roughly
6 seconds.  

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 82 "First Render < 1s..." %}}

You need to focus on getting something on the screen in roughly 1
seconds.  This won't be possible on 2g, but everything you do to optimize this
first render time will help you vastly on all network types.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 83 "Example of optimizing for first render" %}}

Using Progressing rendering you can get something on to the screen and visible to 
the user far more quickly than waiting for the entire page to load.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 84 "How?" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 85 "Follow the critical render path" %}}

Make sure you understand the critical render path, without it you
won't be able to take advantage of progressive rendering.  But the quick
summary is that CSS blocks JS (because JS requires an accurate understanding
of the DOM) and the screen can't be rendered until both CSS and JS are downloaded
and executed.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 86 "Remove render blocking requests" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 87 "Prioritze visible content" %}}

Nuff said.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 88 "What is visible content" %}}

It is the stuff the user sees when they first load the page.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 89 "This is what prioritizing visible content looks like" %}}

It is all the content, and basic styles without fancy web fonts and images.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 90 "Always put your CSS before Js" %}}

Your JS can't execute until it has downloaded the referenced CSS and applied it to 
the current state of the DOM.
 
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 91 "Inline your CSS that you need just for that page" %}}

It will stop you having to make a request that blocks the render

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 92 "This is what it looks like in action" %}}

First render time 4 seconds quicker.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 93 "Compress everything" %}}

Don't be a div. Reduce the amount of data you send.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 94 "Requests are expensive" %}}

Requests are incredibly expensive to create, especially on 2G networks.  Don't 
create huge number of requests that can't be reused by the network particularly
if the resource you are requesting is render-blocking

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 95 "Try pre-connecting" %}}

It removes some of the burden of creating the requests by making it earlier in the
page load.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 96 "Remove redirects" %}}

If you are redirecting the user you are forcing them to open an new network connection
that will mean a DNS lookup, connection establishment potentially adding a second to your
page load time.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 97 "Don't lose control of your page load by including 3rd party scripts" %}}

For example, iframes.  If you really need an iframe or 3rd party widget defer load it.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 98 "Plan for HTTP/2" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 99 "4 out of 5" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 100 "The platform is changing" %}}

We have seen many improvements over the years, but we are still way behind.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 101 "Do you really need advanced capabilities" %}}

Many many apps never touch advanced capabilities, instead all they really 
want is push notifications... If you do need advanced access to hardware, the
web has more capabilities than you probably think.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 102 "Use the Camera" %}}

We have some basic, but richer access to the camera when we need it.  I have another post on the 
way that describes some of the issues that this API has TL;DR it is not actually a camera API.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 103 "Use the mic" %}}
Like Camera access, we have some underlying access to the microphone and we can do some interesting 
things with it.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 104 "Battery" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 105 "Optimise your UX for Permissions" %}}

Probably the least "sexy" API but one of the most important from a user experience point 
of view. Understanding what permissions the user has granted your site allows _you_ to optimize
your UX to ensure that the user knows what you are asking for and why.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 106 "Be Instant" %}}

Coming soon you will be able to access the BLE stack and be able to have access to devices
without needing to install them.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 107 "Understand the network" %}}

Lastly, understanding the network and what is available to the user is critical
for delivering the next generation of mobile experiences. Especially important
for emerging markets where the network isn’t guaranteed to be available when
you need it either in terms of physical link or bandwidth.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 108 "And there is much more coming" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 109 "Background Sync" %}}

The Background sync API will trigger if there is a pending action that occurred
in the browser but when the user was offline. 

For example, imaging you are uploading a form and you go offline.  When the user
comes back online the SW will be woken back up and you (the developer) will be able to 
complete the task.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 110 "Periodic Background Sync" %}}

One step further, you are a developer of a news application and you want your content
to be available for users when they wake up.  The Periodic Sync API will wake the SW
up at intervals to perform some custom processing.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 111 "5 out of 5" %}}

The web has won right?

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 112 "Not by a long way" %}}

There is still a lot we need to do.  Payments is one area where we are so far behind
the native platforms.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 113 "We need to take advantage of what the web is great at" %}}

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 114 "Get a user and get them engaged immediately on the web" %}}

Don't lose them at the install phase of your app. They are already on your site, win
them over there.
