summary: This blog post discusses the importance of balancing valuable content with
  helpful features.  I currently offer content and features like Technorati tags,
  and plan to bring back related searches.  The AJAX application I built helps create
  this value-added data, which I believe is key for reader engagement.  I'm considering
  adding more data like citations and related searches, but I'm cautious about information
  overload.  Maintaining these value-added sections is challenging (except for the
  now-easy Technorati tags).  I'd love to hear your suggestions for other valuable
  data to include!

title: 'The Successes of my first AJAX Application: Part 6 - What I include in my
  Blogs'

I think that this is the most important part of the blog. There are really two sections to it. The content and the value added features.<p />Currently, I provide some content (whether it is interesting or not is a separate question) and some value added features (a list of topics that a reader might be able to find related information) which include the Technorati tag list and the related searches.<p />Okay, the related searches aren't back in yet, but they will be. It is the value added data that I think some people appreciate. It is also the value added data that got me in to this series of Blog posts (I created the AJAX application to help me create construct the value added data).<p />I would like to include more value added data, maybe a citation list, the related searches defiantly. However I think there is a tradeoff. Too much information looks like you are spamming. I will have to weigh up each of the value added data to see which I think is best to include.<p />I will have to get back in to my AJAX application because maintaining the Value Added sections is a nightmare. The Technorati tags are really easy to maintain now ;)<p />Do you have any suggestions for Value Added Data? Please email me <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a>.<p />
