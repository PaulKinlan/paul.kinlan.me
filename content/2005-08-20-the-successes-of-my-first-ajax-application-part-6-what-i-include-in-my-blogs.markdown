I think that this is the most important part of the blog. There are really two sections to it. The content and the value added features.<p />Currently, I provide some content (whether it is interesting or not is a separate question) and some value added features (a list of topics that a reader might be able to find related information) which include the Technorati tag list and the related searches.<p />Okay, the related searches aren't back in yet, but they will be. It is the value added data that I think some people appreciate. It is also the value added data that got me in to this series of Blog posts (I created the AJAX application to help me create construct the value added data).<p />I would like to include more value added data, maybe a citation list, the related searches defiantly. However I think there is a tradeoff. Too much information looks like you are spamming. I will have to weigh up each of the value added data to see which I think is best to include.<p />I will have to get back in to my AJAX application because maintaining the Value Added sections is a nightmare. The Technorati tags are really easy to maintain now ;)<p />Do you have any suggestions for Value Added Data? Please email me <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a>.<p />
