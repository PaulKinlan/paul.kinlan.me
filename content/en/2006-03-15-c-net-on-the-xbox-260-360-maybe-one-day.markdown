This is just a quick post, as I get a lot of hits from people looking for c# and xbox 360 stuff.<p /><a href="http://myownpirateradio.com/2006/03/14/net-on-the-xbox/">http://myownpirateradio.com/2006/03/14/net-on-the-xbox/</a><br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikezintel/archive/2006/03/14/550958.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/mikezintel/archive/2006/03/14/550958.aspx</a><p />The above post indicate that in the future using the CLR on the 360 might be a possibility, what this means for home brew development is unclear because I doubt that you would be allowed to develop on the XBox 360 with out a licence.<p />You never know though, stranger things have happened!<p />
