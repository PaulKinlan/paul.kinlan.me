a reader visited my site the other day with the following search query: ebay asp.net api soap wsdl.<p />I have been trying to use the Ebay api and I have been finding it a little bit awkward to use. It appears to be a massivly monotlithic piece of API. I would have prefered that each API call have its owb WSDL and thus its own SOAP interface. This way I onlyt need to worry about the using and importing a very small stub.<p />I will post some code I have tomorrow but I am yet to determine if it works because for the life of me I cannot create a User Token for authenticating the request. I have tried three things none of which worked:<br /><ol>
<li>I have tried using my Ebay Developer Account</li>
<li>I have also tried my normal ebay account</li>
<li>I have also created a brand new ebay account.</li>
</ol><p>None of the above accounts work (it keeps aying my password is incorrect).  Has anyone had any luck getting a User token for use in the API?</p><br />
