Even after start.com has been updated and Robert Scoble said the Start.com team <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/13.html#a11136">respond quickly to feedback<br /></a><br /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
They also posted Start.com/developer and are looking for feedback on all this stuff. They react fast and seem like they are adding new features every few days.
</blockquote><p />I still haven't had a reply [or any sign of implementation] to my UI improvement suggestion.  I don't think I am being silly, all I would like to hear is someone say, yeah it is good or yup kinlan you'r a fool :).  I know you guys are busy, but everyone elses suggestions seemed to get taken on board.<p />Anyway, here is the email about feedback I sent.<br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
Hi, <br />I really love what you are doing on start.com, but I still have a minor greavance with the way the "x" button on the content panes work. It seems that every pane will close even if I don't confirm the click action by releasing the mouse. It is quite annoying because you can easily remove content panes by mistake. <br />[http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/07/startcom-little-annoyance.html](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/07/startcom-little-annoyance.html) <br />[http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcom-please-listen.html](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcom-please-listen.html) <br />It also seems that you respond to everyone elses critisms except this one, I don't think I am being silly and I do belive that if you fix this it will improve the useablity a bit more <br />Kind Regards, RSVP <br />Paul Kinlan <br />[www.kinlan.co.uk](http://www.kinlan.co.uk)
