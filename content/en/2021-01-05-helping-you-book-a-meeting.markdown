After the Chrome Dev Summit, I had the chance to take some time off and spend it with my family, and during the downtime I got to think about all that has happened over the last year.

I\u2019m incredibly proud of my [team](https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev) and how they responded to the crisis that hit the world this year - we built tools like web.dev/covid to give developers advice on how to keep sites up and running, set up a forum for public services support during the lock-downs; ran web.dev/live and Chrome Dev Summit to help enable you to build well for the web; supported the launch of [vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) to help quantify and understand UX improvements you can make; released a new developer.chorme.com site, updated squoosh, landed many updates to workbox... the list goes on.

All of this was amazing and it was great to see it out there helping people, yet there was one thing that really stood out to me that I missed. I missed direct connections with people, and I would like to rectify that as much as I can this year (given the travel restrictions).

I\u2019m going to run something that Carol and Benji set up at Chrome Dev Summit: \u201cOffice Hours\u201d. Office Hours gave all registered attendees access to our engineering team and the ability to ask them any question ranging from career advice to deep technical questions about the fundamentals of Chrome.

I believe that your access to support shouldn\u2019t be limited to just the time around an event like Chrome Dev Summit, so I\u2019ve opened up my calendar so that you can schedule time with me, ask me any question and I will try and help you as best as I can.

I want to hear about what you are working on and how I can help you. I\u2019m especially excited to hear from developers working in areas that we don\u2019t traditionally reach (South America, India, Russia, the entire continent of Africa, China, Indonesia etc).
