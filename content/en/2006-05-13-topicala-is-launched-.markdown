I might as well anounce the first of the major projects I have been developing in my spare time.<p /><span style="font-size: 180%;">Topicala</span> (<a href="http://www.topicala.com/">http://www.topicala.com/</a>): A Topical search aggregator.<p />Enter a Topic, and see all the related information about that topic.<p />It is still a work in progress but it is nearly finished, some bug fixes and also OPML output is needed, but that won't take long.<p />So feel free and have a play (some example searches):<a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/Kinlan">http://www.topicala.com/tag/Kinlan</a><a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/msdn">http://www.topicala.com/tag/msdn</a><a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/opml">http://www.topicala.com/tag/opml</a><a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/rss">http://www.topicala.com/tag/rss</a><a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/atom">http://www.topicala.com/tag/atom</a><p />Let me know what you think as feedback is very important.<p />
