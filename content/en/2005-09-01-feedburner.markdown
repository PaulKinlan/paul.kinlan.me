It appears that the RSS feed that Feedburner produces wasn't outputting any content to the articles.<p />I think I have fixed it. You can view the RSS feed by clicking the Feedburner Icon in the top left portion of the Title. The ATOM feed is at <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/atom.xml">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/atom.xml</a>.<p />Enjoy!<p />
