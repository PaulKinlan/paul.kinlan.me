title: EBay Offering Free API Usage

Just a quick note, finally Ebay are offering what appears to be free calls to their API system. They call it the Unified Procing Scheme and can be found at <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/roadmap/2005-Q1/unified-schema#documentContent">http://developer.ebay.com/roadmap/2005-Q1/unified-schema#documentContent</a>.<p />This is great news, I have been yamering on in the past that I would not be using it whilst there is a charge to use it.  I know I am not going to change the world, nor am I going to make Ebay Trillions of dollars.  But I suspect there are thousands of people like me who would like to experiment with the API.<p /><br />
