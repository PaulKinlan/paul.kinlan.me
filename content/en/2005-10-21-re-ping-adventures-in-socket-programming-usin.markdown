I always find this kind of interesting<br /><blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After a long hiatus, I am back to posing to my blog. I am going to start out with a series on Socket programming.</p>
<br /><p>In this series, I will show you how to implement a simple Ping client using classes from the [System.Net.Sockets ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemnetsockets.asp)Â namespace. It should be an exciting journey.</p>
<br /><p>For starters, you can familiarize yourself with the RFC for ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) which is the protocol used by the PING client. The RFC for that is here: ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0792.txt](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0792.txt)).</p>
<br /><p></p>
<br /><p>Until next time,</p>
<br /><p>Cheers.</p>

There was no particular reason why I wanted to create a ping client, I just always thought it would be quite cool.  Anyway, watch out on [Feroze Daud's WebLog](http://blogs.msdn.com/feroze_daud/default.aspx).<p />
