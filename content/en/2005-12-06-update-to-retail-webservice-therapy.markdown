A little while ago I <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/retail-web-service-therapy.html">wrote a little blog entry</a> about the fact there are not many (if any) retail based Web Serivce APIS.  That is for things such as Tesco's, Dixon's and HMV etc.  Well it seems that over on <a href="http://www.maskell.uk.com/">www.maskell.uk.com</a> there is an answer.  There is an <a href="http://www.maskell.uk.com/webServices/Asda/Store.asmx" title="" target="">Soap API</a> for <a href="http://www.asda.co.uk/" title="" target="">ASDA</a>.  All I can say is Wow.  I am not too sure how he does it but it might inlvove screen scraping or something.  I am not too sure.  But anyway it is cool.  Give it a go!<p />
