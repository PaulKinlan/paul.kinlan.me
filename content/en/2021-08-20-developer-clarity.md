* Drip feed of API's
* Deprecate and Break. Recent events were a stark reminder that empathy is key. 
* Time for a change.
  * On one hand people don't like Apple's model of ship twice a year with an OS update, on the other Chrome is pushing too quickly. Alex Komoroske talked about elastic band and tension and stretch too far it snaps.
    * Have we reached that points
  * web.dev - appears Chrome only.
    * too much change.
    * too quickly.
  * Refernce - too fast, can't keep up.  Other's shouldn't have to work because of our lack of support.
  * How can we slow down, but keep pace? Maybe batch more. The general population of developers don't need to know about all new API's on the day they launch.
