There are a few little services that I would love to see on the web, but I can&#39;t seem to find them anywhere. <p /><div><ul><li>Twitter Favourites -&gt; Instapaper (or xyz)</li></ul><ul><li>I can&#39;t seem to find anything like this, but I would love to see a webhook that sends things to Instapaper, I hate that I have to wait for integration of a 3rd party app to be able to send things to Instapaper or another service that I use.</li> </ul><li>RSS -&gt; Email</li><ul><li>I know these have existed in the past, and some exist now like on FeedBurner - but all of these services send email archive of blog posts and not even the full blog post at that.  Posterous is part of the way there. I spend most of my day in email, so it is really easy for me to read an individual mail - I can filter it so that they are in a separate area that I can they use to quickly grok what I am interested in.  I don&#39;t particularly want to go to Google Reader etc.  Ideally it would be pubsubhubbub enabled so I can get the email nearly straight away.</li> </ul><div>More to come when I think of them.</div></div><p /><div>If they don&#39;t exist, I might create them as Open projects soon.</div>
