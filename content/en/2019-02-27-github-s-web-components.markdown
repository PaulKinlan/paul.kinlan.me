I was looking for a quick markdown editor on [https://www.webcomponents.org/](https://www.webcomponents.org/) so that I can make posting to this blog easier and I stumbled across a neat set of components by [github](https://www.webcomponents.org/author/github).

I knew that they had the `<time-element>` but I didn't know they had a such a nice and simple set of useful elements.
