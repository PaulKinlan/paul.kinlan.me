I love watching Corridor Crew. They are a bunch of amazing SFX creators out in LA
who push what is possible in VFX using what appears (to me) to be commodity hardware
and tools.

They recently showed a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmJ74774RO8) that
pit their team against each other to rotoscope a person out of a video and put in
a new background element using a variety of techniques: traditional (by hand),
modern tools, new enhanced Tools, and an special ML way.

The ML way one, it took 6 minutes to complete and is a game changer (according to
the team - the traditional way would take weeks etc). Best of all the [tool was a 
web app](https://runwayml.com/green-screen/)!

It made me think. What challenges do developers have that is incredibly manual, that
is hard to solve with traditional software but could be inferred..

Here's my list of challenges I want to research:
