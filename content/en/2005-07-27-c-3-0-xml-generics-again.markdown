Now I am certain it was a joke! MattWar made a comment on his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mattwar/archive/2005/07/24/442611.aspx">blog post </a>and one of his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mattwar/archive/2005/07/24/442611.aspx#443661" rel="tag">XML Generics</a> examples' implies that a generic can be defined from an XML Schema.<p />If it is not a joke, I don't really see the point. The type is an XML schema that has to be defined in the code. Why not just create a class? If the type was based off an XML schema that could be streamed into then that might be interesting.<p />
