I have read and listended to a lot of what Bill Hill has discused and I respect his opinion a lot.<p /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/03/03/543181.aspx">He has made a post</a> about the decision to turn on Cleartype in IE7 Beta 2.  I recommend that if you read the post if you want to learn more, but to soundbite [or rather "lift"] from the blog entry.<br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The decision to turn ClearType on by default in IE is unusual, but was made because solid research over the past few years has shown conclusively that it improves reading - the task at which IE users spend most of their time. </blockquote><p />I have not noticed any problems with cleartype, I find it easier to read text that is cleartyped, for some reason I concerntrate more.  I have however, noticed problems with Blogger [and other sites] with IE 7 Beta 2 rendering the pages correctly.<p />
