Tech crunch has a little article about Memorandum and Blogniscient.  I have tried them both, I didn't actually think they were that great.  <p />I can tell you why I definatly won't be using them.  <strong>I can't flipping spell their names when I type them out in a web browser!</strong><p /><blockquote>
<p>[[posterous-content:bEyGetkiDskBgseCmqJD]]Ben Ruedlinger’s [Blogniscient](http://www.blogniscient.com) relaunched [today](http://www.technosight.com/blog/the-new-face-of-blogniscient/) with a completely new look and feel. An old screenshot of the service is [here](http://www.technosight.com/images/blogniscient.jpg).</p>
<br />	<p>Blogniscient is a blog news organizer that, like [Memeorandum](http://tech.memeorandum.com), uses a propreitary algorithm for determining what’s hot in the blogosphere at any given time. Unlike [Digg](http://www.digg.com), which creates news items based on user bookmarking and subsequent voting to determine front page items, Blogniscient and Memeorandum are automated.</p>
