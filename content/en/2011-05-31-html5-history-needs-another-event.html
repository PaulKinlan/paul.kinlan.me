<p>I love the HTML5 History API, it makes developing applications
with a consistent URL scheme across server and client super simple, however
it doesn&rsquo;t come without its problems.</p>

<p>When developing the <a href="https://github.com/PaulKinlan/leviroutes">LeviRoutes URL routing</a> framework it
became obvious that we need some changes to the specification as-is.
The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onpopstate">Mozilla documentation</a> reports that
onpopstate is called whenever the history object
changes, unfortunately this is not the case, and is not the case with the
spec either, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/history.html#event-popstate">HTML5 Spec</a>
indicates:
&ldquo;The popstate event is fired in certain cases when navigating to a session
history entry.&rdquo;, which you can logically assume to be only on a forward,
backwards navigation, not a replaceState or pushState.</p>

<p>This might sound odd.  There is no mechanism to detect change in url
<em>after</em>it changes.  You get notification via onpopstate when the user
navigates
forwards or backwards through your application, but not actually when it
changes.  This is apposed to onhashchange which does fire when the document
fragment changes.</p>

<p>This causes us problems.</p>

<p>LeviRoutes listens to changes in your URL, it allows you to build
applications that are responsive to the current URL, and are decoupled from
navigation.  So rather than have your code littered with &ldquo;if(url == &rdquo;/&ldquo;) {
doA(); } if (url == &rdquo;/categories") { doB(); } you can now specify:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>var app = routes();
app.get(&quot;/&quot;, doA);
app.get(&quot;/categories&quot;, doB);</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Simple right?</p>

<p>It would be excellent if it was that simple, but it is not.  We don&rsquo;t know
when the URL changes via pushState.  This forces us o bind our logic in our
controller to call the same code that LeviRoutes would call when it detects
a change in URL via normal navigation.</p>

<p>Now I have to bastardise my code:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>var app = routes();
app.get(&quot;/&quot;, doA);
app.get(&quot;/categories&quot;, doB);

.....
function gotoA () {
    history.pushState({}, &quot;A&quot;, /);
    doA();
}
...</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Pretty messy right?</p>

<p>I would love to see an event &ldquo;onstatechanged&rdquo; (or perhaps, onpushstate and
onreplacestate) triggered when the user pushes or replaces state on to the
history object so that I can capture the code and return to my simple
routing logic.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>var app = routes();
app.get(&quot;/&quot;, doA);
app.get(&quot;/categories&quot;, doB);

function gotoA () {
    history.pushState({}, &quot;A&quot;, /);
}</pre></div>
</div>


<p>I am not the only person asking for this:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=onpushstate">http://www.google.com/search?q=onpushstate</a></p>

<p>So, how am I going to solve this problem?  I am going to wrap the History
API and proxy pushState to call the natural pushState and also fire a new
custom event.  Hmph :\</p>
