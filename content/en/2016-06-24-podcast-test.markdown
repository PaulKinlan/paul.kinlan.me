This is a test.  It might not look like much but I have integrated
WebTorrent streaming in to my blog and bit torrent URLs so that 
I can distribute content across the web without relying on my
site.

It does use the WebSeed BEP so that it always has an unchocked
seed (my site).  I am going to start experimenting a little more 
with this to see how to measure analytics etc.
