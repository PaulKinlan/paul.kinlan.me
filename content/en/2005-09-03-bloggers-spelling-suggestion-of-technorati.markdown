title: Bloggers Spelling Suggestion of Technorati
published: true

I was spell checking my [last entry](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/another-thing-i-just-noticed.html), and Blogger's spelling suggestion for Technorati was Degenerate.<p />It made me chuckle.<p />Bloggers spell checker is so poor, it doesn't recognise Blog [or British English Spelling]. At least it keeps me on my toes.<p />
