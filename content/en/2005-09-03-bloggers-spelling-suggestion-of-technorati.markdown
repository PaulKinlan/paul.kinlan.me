title: Bloggers Spelling Suggestion of Technorati

I was spell checking my <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/another-thing-i-just-noticed.html">last entry</a>, and Blogger's spelling suggestion for Technorati was Degenerate.<p />It made me chuckle.<p />Bloggers spell checker is so poor, it doesn't recognise Blog [or British English Spelling]. At least it keeps me on my toes.<p />
