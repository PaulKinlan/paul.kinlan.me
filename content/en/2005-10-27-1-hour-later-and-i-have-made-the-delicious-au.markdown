I am quite pleased with myself.  After 1 hour and using the Framework I have been creating for a while for the AJAX Tagger I have created a piece of software that will automatically post to [Delicious](http://del.icio.us) the tags that are related to any page on <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk" title="www.kinlan.co.uk">www.kinlan.co.uk</a>.<p />It only works on Kinlan.co.uk, but it you have a [Delicious](http://del.icio.us) Account please try this and let me know if I should develop it futher.<p />Here are the instructions, Press "Goto", When the page has loaded press "Analyze".  Once the Tags Come Back, select the ones you want and type in your [Delicious](http://del.icio.us) username and password and then press "Submit".<p />The passwords are sent plain text, but this is the way Delicious does it and I don't process them because I call [Delicious](http://del.icio.us) straight away.<p />IE6+ is needed and so is The Cross Domain Data Island support.<p />It works for anypage on my site.  I will endeavour to get some support for sites outside my domain.<p /><a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/DeliTag" title="DeliTag">DeliTag</a><p />
