title: Some hCard Stats

<p>I have started processing hCard stats on <a href="http://www.topicala.com">www.topicala.com</a> (stats can be found at <a href="http://www.topicala.com/ping/hCardStats">www.topicala.com/ping/hCardStats</a>) with thanks to <a href="http://www.pingerati.net">www.pingerati.net</a>.</p> <p>hCards are a microformat that describe your contact information in a manner that can be parsed by machines, but is also human readable and therefore can be included inline with any html that you make.</p> <p>Pingerati is run by Technorati and is a service that notifies other services (such as mine) of updates to peoples sites and blogs.  </p> <p>At the moment pingerati pings me whenever a hCard is updated on a page.  I record this information and only use it in some stats at the moment.</p> <p>To get your hCard into my stats I would suggest that you simply make sure that you ping pingerati at the following url <code>http://pingerati.net/ping/[url that is updated]</code> (details can be found at: <a href="http://www.pingerati.net/about/">http://www.pingerati.net/about/</a>).  This can be done by configuring your blog writer to include the pingerati ping service with any other pings it does.</p> <p>I would like to see Microformats being taken up because there are a lot of cool services that can be provided once the data can be understood by machines.</p> <p>Once topicala has enough information there are some services that I will be adding to make topicala a lot better.</p> <p>If you are wondering how to make an hCard simply visit <a href="http://microformats.org/code/hcard/creator">http://microformats.org/code/hcard/creator</a> </p> <p>tags: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/hcard" rel="tag">hcard</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/microformat" rel="tag">microformat</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/pingerati" rel="tag">pingerati</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/technorati" rel="tag">technorati</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/topicala" rel="tag">topicala</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/ping" rel="tag">ping</a></p>
