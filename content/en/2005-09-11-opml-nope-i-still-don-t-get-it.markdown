In an earlier post I talked about promising to include an OPML list of the blogs I read in the page. Seriously, [is this all](http://feeds.scripting.com/whatIsOpml#usingOpmlToExchangeSubscriptionLists) that it does? I just don't get what OPML is supposed to help me do or to how it helps anyone who reads my blog.<p />Here is a list of all the people ("Web Celebs") who like OPML and must know what to use it for; If anyone of them could tell me I would be very greatful. [I am trying to find more people]<p />Robert Scoble;<br />Dave Winner;<p />Hmm, I really do think I am missing something. Should I be using OPML to help me find people who are OPMLing and know what it is for?<p /><strong>All I am trying to say is that I don't know what I am supposed to do with it!</strong><p />ps. I tried to use Technorati's Blog Finder to find OPML supporting Blogs, there where 4 I think. Way to go Technorati!<p />pps. If your like me. The best resource I found was over on Wikipedi [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML)].<p />
