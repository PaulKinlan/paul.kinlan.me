After a comment from <a>Zoli Erdos</a> on my [blog entry ](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/technoratiboooooo.html)about Technorati, I don't completly agree with the article, but then again the only problem I have seen is that my posts don't get indexed correctly [although, each time that I mention they don't about a day later they appear in the listing]<p />I do however agree with the following statement:<p /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>Now, let’s talk about communication: emailing techorati support is a<br />complete dead end. Bloggers quickly learned the trick: emailing Dave Sifry<br />(CEO), or perhaps Kevin Marks, or tagging blog entries with their names used to<br />result in a response, and sometimes even corrective action. That’s no<br />longer the case. I understand. The CEO personally emailing back is<br />not exactly scalable communication. But why doesn’t Technorati have a<br />searchable Knowledge Base, or at least a FAQ of known issues and<br />solutions? This is really Customer Service 101.</p></blockquote>We need a FAQ, we need a knowledge base, we need better community support from your support.  You can't continue with the "support service" as is, because, it doesn't support any service. [ps I don't think a Wiki is the answer either, the developer Wiki is rather rubbish, the pages should just be static support pages]<p />I really don't know if we should be complaining about this, after all Technorati is still a free service, it has a free access API and it has provided me with a lot of hits on my blog.<p />
