Check out [YMDB.com](http://www.YMDB.com), it is a simple and easy to use site that allows you to list your favorite films and see who else likes what you like.<p />I think it would suit an AJAX Style interface because adding in titles and moving them through the lists is pretty tedious.  Other than that it is good.<p />[My Profile](http://www.ymdb.com/kinlan/l29716_ukuk.html).<p />
