It is comming along quite well.  The priority queues seem to work okay.  I think the number of queues and the polling interval might need to be tweaked but it is still good.<p />One area that is not working too well is querying the Technorati search engine about the number of Post a Tag is in.  It is really slow, it takes about two seconds to perform a query.  That is a bit too slow.  Has anybody had any experience with this?  Can you speed it up by restricting the number of blogs to return in the result?<p />The area that I am working on is getting the related documents results back.  It works okay, but needs improving.  Currently it returns a count of the number of related documents for the last search only, however it includes all the documents that it finds for all the selected tags.  So I need to sort that out.<p />Sorry for this entry being a bit haywire, but I wanted to get it all down quickly. :) (Partly as a memory aid! ;))<p />
