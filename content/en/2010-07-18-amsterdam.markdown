I am just about to visit Amsterdam on a business trip. The last time I went to Amsterdam was when I was 7 (I think). I remember really enjoying it then, granted I was 7 and I loved trams, but I am really looking forward to visiting it again. <p /> What would people recommend to do if I have any free time over the next two days? <p /> I plan in taking a couple of photos so I can at least try and document some of this trip.
