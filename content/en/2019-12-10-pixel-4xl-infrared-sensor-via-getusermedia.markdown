It's turns out that you can access the pixel 4 face detection IR camera via normal `getUserMedia`. The interesting thing is that if you try to do face unlock when this camera is being used (the bit where it throws things on to your face) the system will just flat refuse to do any of the face unlock process and that makes sense.

Anyone got any ideas about what we can do with infrared camera access?
