I missed out on the last post trying out the alpha transparency.  I know its been blogged about <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markms/29803567/">here</a>, but I should have really tried it out.<p />Well anyway, here goes!<p /><span style="background-color: black; color: white;">TEST [[posterous-content:jyixBbeegBcvzJqsaxAg]]</span><p /><a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/images/imgFeedTran.png">Here</a> is the original picture <p />Its garish I know, but it highlights the green fade to a white colour on the back ground (html span )of black . Eep, but cool :)<p />
