More details can be found on [my main blog](/domcurl).

The concept is pretty simple, as developers move towards a web where they
generate entire UI's and dynamically render content with JavaScript, the awesome
cUrl tool won't be able to return the data users expect. I wanted the power of
the command-line tool cUrl but with the ability to execute JavaScript on the
page.
