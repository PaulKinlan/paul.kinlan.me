description: "A simple web app that helps you with Crosswords and Codewords"
---

During the lockdown me and my partner got into crosswords and codewords, and with my 
partners first language not being English, and me mostly failing English in school I built
[this little web app](https://wordhelper.app/) to help us find potential solutions for 
crosswords.

I built this simple app because 1) I didn't want to install an app, and 2) a lot of the 
sites on the Web are laden with junk adverts or complex syntax. I just wanted something simple
to use and that loaded instantly.

To use the app, you just include all the letters you know and use _ or . for the letters
that you don't know (i.e, [CA___A](https://wordhelper.app/find/CA___A)). If you know there 
are two letters that will be the same but you don't know what they are you can use a 
digit (i.e, [B12121](https://wordhelper.app/find/B12121)).

I will do a technical write up soon, but it's a pretty traditional PWA.
