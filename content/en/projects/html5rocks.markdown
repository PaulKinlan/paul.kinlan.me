[HTML5Rocks](https://html5rocks.com/) was an incredibly fun project. Started in
2010 this project was designed to show and inspire developers with what is the
web platform is capabable of. We created a lot of articles and samples that
really pushed what users and developers thought the platform could do. We showed
how to make simple offline experiences, how to use web rtc, how to implement
drag and drop etc. It was a great project.

I took over the lead of the project in 2013 and worked with Paul Lewis on a
redesign and a new content narrative.

Ultimately we couldn't devote the long-term resources the site needed to keep
developers engaged, and I decided to move [HTML5Rocks
Updates](https://updates.html5rocks.com) to [Web
Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/updates) and start to turn down
the main site. We've kept the content up because some of the articles such as
the Introduction to Web RTC are 'canonical' articles in the industry. We
re-directed other content to Web Fundamentals.

Myself and the entire Chrome Developer Relations team are incredibly proud of
what we achieved with HTML5Rocks - for a time it was *the* place to go to learn
about what was possible with HTML5.

I learnt alot about content management and tooling in this process. We made the
site super simple to deploy and maintain which meant it was easier to deploy
content to, but we didn't move to mobile as quickly as we should have done and
we didn't keep the cadence of content up that would drive people back into the
site daily.
