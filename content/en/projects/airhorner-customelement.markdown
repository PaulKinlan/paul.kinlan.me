I made the [`<air-horner>`](https://github.com/paulkinlan/air-horner/) custom
element to learn more about the web component ecosystem and how to deploy them
at scale. I don't expect this to be used by anyone, but it helped me set a
direction for my team in how we try and support and plan for a web component
future.

I learn't a couple of significant things:

* We don't know how to deploy these at scale yet.
* With HTML Imports going away, at the time of writing we don't have a good
  way of including templates that are anything but strings in JavaScript. It
  looks like `lit-html` might be a good path.
* There wasn't a lot of guidance on the web about `attributes` vs `properties`.
* Deploying multiple assets with one element is hard - where do my audio files go?
* Theming is still a pain.
* I really like slots. I love the idea of reprojection.

If you are really interested, you can see it below.
