title: IE7 Beta 1 Minor Annoyances In Tabbed Browsing
published: true
---
After futher playing with IE7, I have come accross some other annoyances with Tabbed Browsing.<p /><ul>
<br /><li>Modal Dialog boxes lock the whole of IE7, why can't they just make the tab that launched the dialog box locked out.</li>
<br /><li>Hovering over the tab doesn't seem to pop a tooltip up,  If I have two pages open on the same site, with each site having a long title I can't really work out which of the two tabs has the content I need.</li>
<br /><li>I would like a quick way to close a tab down<br /><ul><li>a) without having to go to the right of the screen</li></ul>
<br />
</li>
<li>b) without having to right click on the tab</li>
<br />
</ul><br /><li>Opening a new tab doesn't take you to your selected homepage.  I would like it as an option to be able to take you to your homepage.  I might for instance have google or some other information portal as my start page.</li><p /><br />I accept the fact that some of these might have good arguments against having them, but I these are things that frustrate me a little whilst using IE7.<p />
