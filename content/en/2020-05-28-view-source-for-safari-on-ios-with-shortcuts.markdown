I love [view-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-source_URI_scheme), it's a nifty super power of the web that nearly all mobile browsers are trying to kill. Not exactly sure why. View-source is what got me into web development because I could see how other people structured their pages, and at the time I started web development it was pretty much the only way to debug web pages.

I've also been using my iPad Pro whilst I am not at work for the next month or so... It's a great device, and it appears to be locked down in a way that restricts me from doing exactly what I want... this is until I found out about the Shortcuts app that is built in to iOS.

Shortcuts let you build small utilities, programs and automations that perform actions on certain user gestures like "Share a Page", or "Open an app", or "Connect to WiFi".

Now that I can share URLs to an "app", I can do a lot of things that are not really possible on mobile devices.

I created [this "View Source" shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7ec2af9dfa6a4a0aa8ddfc765b2e63c1) that you can use (if you trust me) to Share a page from Safari or Chrome and quickly view the source.

Here it is in action:

There is one major caveat. It doesn't inspect the exact instance of the page you are running, it has to the page in a 3rd party site that I built (https://www-source.glitch.me) / [source](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/www-source) - this means that if you are logged in, or there is any state that is shared (such as cookies) then it will *not* display the same content that you are viewing.

It's kinda hard to share the source code of a Shortcuts, so here is a screenshot:

Have fun.

I really hope that Safari (and Chrome) can deprecate the need for this shortcut.
