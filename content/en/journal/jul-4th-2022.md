  * Comments: [The web is not poor man’s native (2015) | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31967011) - It was interesting to read [#](#62c2aa50-c0d4-475c-b0a8-a551e1723f90)<a name="62c2aa50-c0d4-475c-b0a8-a551e1723f90"></a>
* Reflecting on how I write these notes - I read a lot of websites and then I drop the link in to `logseq` and then use my plugin to get the pages title, I noticed everyone always has the site name at the end of the page "— {title}" or "| {title}" and I'm just left wondering why there isn't a `<site>` element (or something similar) that you can use to describe the site or origin that the page is on. It's visually unappealing for me, but more broadly I wonder how it's rendered in other assistive technology?
