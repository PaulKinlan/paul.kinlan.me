* Found [RedGradient - Css Gradient Editor](https://red-gradient.com/) - it looks pretty neat.
  * I got DM'ed based off this article - [Quickly create nice CSS gradients with the CSS Gradient Creator](https://web.dev/css-gradient-generator/)

* I bought some NFC tags and I can program them with this [Web NFC Sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-nfc/).
  * Years ago I had this idea for Google IO (before we get further, it was shot down immediately and you will see why) where you would have a Web App that would have an avatar with some attributes and if you tapped your phone against another persons phone with the web app open it they would "intermingle" and create a new offspring avatar with the combined attributes... I thought at the time it would be interesting to track that state and see how people connected. ... ... Anyway, I still have a similar idea, but I want to explore encoding state on to a NFC tag, reading it and then having it mutated and written back. It could be a simple guestbook, to a game. I think the area is interesting for sure.
