* Read [Adactio: Journal—Democratising dev](https://adactio.com/journal/19356)
  * This is another great post, and there's this bit at the end:
> Don’t get me wrong. I love having my own website. Like, I *really* love it. But I’m also well aware that it doesn’t scale. It’s unreasonable to expect someone to learn new skills just to make a web page about, say, an event they want to publicise.
  * I don't always think it's the complexity of building the site that is the biggest blocker to a lot of people, it's the deploying and running. When I speak to a lot of small businesses about getting online, they say "we're on Facebook", so I ask why? "It's free, it looks good and it works" is often the answer. I'm glad that Jeremy mentioned it at the end of the post.
> Convenience isn’t the only thing you get from using a silo like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Medium. You also get “free” hosting …until you don’t (see GeoCities, MySpace, and [many, many more](https://indieweb.org/site-deaths)).

Something here needs to be solved for the masses. The value of these sites is that production of content on to them is incredibly simple and there is a network that drives engagement and visibility.

It's entirely feasible that someone could create an online tool for an event site, it spits out all the HTML and CSS, social-tags, all the stuff you need, but then you need to get it onto a URL which means paying for a domain and hosting, and then socialising it etc.
  * > Wouldn’t it be great if everyone had a place on the web that they could truly call their own? Today you need to have an uneccesary[sic] degree of technical understanding to publish something at a URL you control.

I'd love everyone to have their own URL, but I don't always think the technical understanding is biggest the barrier, it's completely unclear to many the value of being online on a URL that you own, when there is immediate value on the other platforms. That is something I think we need to solve first, the technology is then easier and maybe more incentivised.
* Read [Let websites framebust out of native apps | Holovaty.com](https://www.holovaty.com/writing/framebust-native-apps/)
  * It's a long and *very* good read and boils down to:

> So my proposal is this: Apple and Google should honor the existing  `X-Frame-Options`  HTTP header in webviews. If a website is loaded into a webview, and the website includes the appropriate  `X-Frame-Options`  header, the mobile OS should immediately stop loading the webview and open the URL in the user’s preferred web browser.

I do like this solution and I don't disagree with it, it puts the emphasis on the developer to own their experience, however it means that the user doesn't have a choice in this, which goes against many principles of a User Agent. As a Developer Advocate for 'a browser', you'd think I'd be all over 'send the user to the browser' narrative - but... I don't know if I am, part of me really struggles to define what constitutes a browser and where one starts and another ends. I'd be interested to see how many people know what a browser is...

  * I do like these little bits of joy. Although I do wonder if we should encourage more use of the  `progress` HTML element.
* I've been thinking about [Web Push](../entry/web-push) and [Notifications](../entry/notifications) coming to iOS and MacOS and it made me recollect the demo that [Paul Lewis](../entry/paul-lewis) made where he build [a game inside a notification](https://twitter.com/aerotwist/status/804411265439383552)

  * I'm personally never sure why React makes sense for games, but the output and experience is spectacular.
