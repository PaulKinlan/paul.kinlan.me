* [What's new in Svelte: May 2022](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-new-in-svelte-may-2022)
  * Really liked the community mentions, for example: [GitHub - liveblocks/pixel-art-together: Pixel Art Together is a multiplayer pixel art editor powered by Liveblocks.](https://github.com/liveblocks/pixel-art-together)
  * Steady progress continues to be made
  * I'm seeing more and more mentions of tools like [netlify](../entry/netlify) and [vercel](../entry/vercel) and I'm wondering how this plays out in the long run
* [CSS Toggles Explainer &amp; Proposal](https://css.oddbird.net/toggles/explainer/)
  * State without JS. nice. Spec has more details about how it would work 
 [CSS Toggles](https://tabatkins.github.io/css-toggle/)
  * I remember talking to [Nicole Sullivan](../entry/nicole-sullivan) about this a while ago and it's great to see these primitives being explored.
  * Great to see  https://open-ui.org/
* https://daverupert.com/2022/05/notes-from-a-gopher-site/
  * Delightful to see gopher sites, it reminds when I was learning Windows MFC programming and Sockets, all the demos were `gopher` servers and clients
  * Also reminds of .plan files with [John Carmack](../entry/john-carmack)
  * There's something nice about the textual web.
