  * [Introducing the 2022 State of Crypto Report - a16z crypto](https://a16zcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-report-a16z-2022/) [#](#628394ff-4769-42b6-ab79-26d5f910263c)<a name="628394ff-4769-42b6-ab79-26d5f910263c"></a>
    * This article overall does a poor job of "The State of Crypto" - it should read "The state of a16z's investments in Crypto". The full summary is [here](https://a16zcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/state-of-crypto-2022_a16z-crypto.pdf) is more interesting.

  * Wrt to "Crypto" I just still don't know where I am in this space. [#](#6283909e-ee9f-41be-bc17-e581f8f6b514)<a name="6283909e-ee9f-41be-bc17-e581f8f6b514"></a>
    * Do I like the idea of a globally distributed database, authentication, payments, etc. Yes. [#](#628390aa-6223-4be1-b457-d2b2bcf8d136)<a name="628390aa-6223-4be1-b457-d2b2bcf8d136"></a>
    * Do I like or even understand the million different coins and NFT projects. No. [#](#628390cd-a97e-422a-8353-787d390c604b)<a name="628390cd-a97e-422a-8353-787d390c604b"></a>

    * I thought this was a made up term, but then went down a rabbit hole on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=%E2%80%9Cprice-innovation%E2%80%9D+cycle&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart) [#](#62839150-f8eb-420f-ba35-d73e4fdd5b5f)<a name="62839150-f8eb-420f-ba35-d73e4fdd5b5f"></a>
    * There's mixed terminology being used imo. [#](#628391a4-4cfc-4e0a-ba7a-4c2090b234e6)<a name="628391a4-4cfc-4e0a-ba7a-4c2090b234e6"></a>
      * A16Z if focusing on an increasing price driving an innovation cycle. Hype. [#](#628391ae-4936-4d59-ad5b-153fa1cc39e4)<a name="628391ae-4936-4d59-ad5b-153fa1cc39e4"></a>
      * Many papers are referring price being a key driver of customer acquisition and companies "innovate" in price space and manage strategies around that. Additionally, lower prices mean there needs to be lower costs. [#](#628391bc-453a-4044-a6e9-0af84dacef5f)<a name="628391bc-453a-4044-a6e9-0af84dacef5f"></a>
      * I personally don't think the term "price innovation" in both senses makes sense. I feel like A16Z is trying to force a term to be used to replace the term "Hype". That's not to say that things don't great created an innovation is not happening though [#](#62839378-c7d7-47e4-863f-904f39965220)<a name="62839378-c7d7-47e4-863f-904f39965220"></a>
    * I've spoken to a number of founders and VP's at crypto related companies who have said similar things, however the framing that I hear is that there is too much hype driven by the current prices, when there is a crash/reset there is a nice quiet period where people who have ideas stick with it.

  * "Founders who swore off tech and the internet in the aftermath of the dotcom crash missed the best opportunities of the decade: cloud computing, social networks, online video streaming, smartphones… _Now is the time to consider what the equivalent successes will be in web3._" [#](#62838f84-0ee6-483e-adc8-7946e1f6c435)<a name="62838f84-0ee6-483e-adc8-7946e1f6c435"></a>
    * Feels kinda optimistic. [#](#62838faa-c37f-4c4b-889f-0dd3bf2cbc6b)<a name="62838faa-c37f-4c4b-889f-0dd3bf2cbc6b"></a>

      * It feels like arbritage right now. The creators who are first, fare best. [#](#62839476-acf9-4bd4-91ad-5df6cae7d981)<a name="62839476-acf9-4bd4-91ad-5df6cae7d981"></a>
      * Comparison to Twitter, FB, YT seems odd. Free service vs ... FB and Twitter never have said they will monetize you. [#](#6283952c-a54b-422f-b06c-e98c19226770)<a name="6283952c-a54b-422f-b06c-e98c19226770"></a>
    * The numbers here are just bizarre. I don't believe you can trust any of the numbers in this part of the report. It's comparing actual $ payments from services with services that are not back by $. [#](#628617ee-c634-409e-86d7-d50e352eb3eb)<a name="628617ee-c634-409e-86d7-d50e352eb3eb"></a>
      * 22,000 creators vs millions on other platforms, and then using averages to present this as the state. Play with the same numbers please. [#](#6287ccb9-1fb3-4205-a324-643576f75a0c)<a name="6287ccb9-1fb3-4205-a324-643576f75a0c"></a>
      * The creator number is off as well, it's caveated as the number of ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens.... I mean, that's not a creator, that's like saying each YT video is a creator. Right? [#](#6287cd50-5c06-4d5c-914c-ff1fa1acdb55)<a name="6287cd50-5c06-4d5c-914c-ff1fa1acdb55"></a>
    * "Take rate" 30% vs 2.5%, but it's not accounting for transaction fee's that are provided by the platforms either, nor creator fees. [#](#6287cbdc-bc6d-47be-8b9c-ce705fc4c612)<a name="6287cbdc-bc6d-47be-8b9c-ce705fc4c612"></a>

    * At least an order of magnitude difference... and it puts it towards "1991" on the lower bound. [#](#628394ed-d9b3-4005-a307-02ead554084e)<a name="628394ed-d9b3-4005-a307-02ead554084e"></a>
