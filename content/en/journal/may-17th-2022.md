* Read [Google All Set To Launch &#8216;Advanced Web Apps Fund](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2022/05/google-all-set-to-launch-advanced-web.html)
  * Actual announcement - [Advanced Web Apps Fund - Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/advanced-web-apps-fund/)
* Read https://twitter.com/a16z/thread/1526524210927083520 "State of Crypto"
  * [Introducing the 2022 State of Crypto Report - a16z crypto](https://a16zcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-report-a16z-2022/)
    * This article overall does a poor job of "The State of Crypto" - it should read "The state of a16z's investments in Crypto". The full summary is [here](https://a16zcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/state-of-crypto-2022_a16z-crypto.pdf) is more interesting.
  * Wrt to "Crypto" I just still don't know where I am in this space.
    * Do I like the idea of a globally distributed database, authentication, payments, etc. Yes.
    * Do I like or even understand the million different coins and NFT projects. No.
  * “price-innovation” cycle.
    * 2020 - https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/the-crypto-price-innovation-cycle/
    * I thought this was a made up term, but then went down a rabbit hole on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=%E2%80%9Cprice-innovation%E2%80%9D+cycle&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart)
    * There's mixed terminology being used imo.
      * A16Z if focusing on an increasing price driving an innovation cycle. Hype.
      * Many papers are referring price being a key driver of customer acquisition and companies "innovate" in price space and manage strategies around that. Additionally, lower prices mean there needs to be lower costs.
      * I personally don't think the term "price innovation" in both senses makes sense. I feel like A16Z is trying to force a term to be used to replace the term "Hype". That's not to say that things don't great created an innovation is not happening though
    * I've spoken to a number of founders and VP's at crypto related companies who have said similar things, however the framing that I hear is that there is too much hype driven by the current prices, when there is a crash/reset there is a nice quiet period where people who have ideas stick with it.
  * "Founders who swore off tech and the internet in the aftermath of the dotcom crash missed the best opportunities of the decade: cloud computing, social networks, online video streaming, smartphones… _Now is the time to consider what the equivalent successes will be in web3._"
    * Feels kinda optimistic.
  * "NFT"
    * "The take-rates of web3 platforms offer fairer economic terms."
      * It feels like arbritage right now. The creators who are first, fare best.
      * Comparison to Twitter, FB, YT seems odd. Free service vs ... FB and Twitter never have said they will monetize you.
    * The numbers here are just bizarre. I don't believe you can trust any of the numbers in this part of the report. It's comparing actual $ payments from services with services that are not back by $.
      * 22,000 creators vs millions on other platforms, and then using averages to present this as the state. Play with the same numbers please.
      * The creator number is off as well, it's caveated as the number of ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens.... I mean, that's not a creator, that's like saying each YT video is a creator. Right?
    * "Take rate" 30% vs 2.5%, but it's not accounting for transaction fee's that are provided by the platforms either, nor creator fees.
    * I wish it talked more about memberships.
  * "We estimate there are somewhere between 7M and 50M active Ethereum users today. (Compared to the internet, that puts us somewhere around the year 1995.)"
    * At least an order of magnitude difference... and it puts it towards "1991" on the lower bound.
* We had an internal team session about screenrecording
  * Read https://howtoegghead.com/instructor/screencasting/ about Screencasting
  * Read [Region Capture - Chrome Platform Status](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5712447794053120)
    * Tried [Region Capture Demo](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-region/demo/)
  * Naturally phones came up. [Andre Bandarra](../entry/andre-bandarra) reminded us that he made a [Web ADB](../entry/web-adb) library and screen recording app
    * [GitHub - GoogleChromeLabs/wadb: A TypeScript implementation of the Android Debug Bridge(ADB) protocol over WebUSB](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wadb/)
    * [WebADB Screenrecord](https://screenrecord.bandarra.me/) - this is a great example of the power of [Web USB](../entry/web-usb)
