* Read [Manifest v3 in Firefox: Recap & Next Steps | Mozilla Add-ons Community Blog](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2022/05/18/manifest-v3-in-firefox-recap-next-steps/)
> We believe that working with other browser vendors in the context of the WECG is the best path toward a healthy ecosystem that balances the needs of its users and developers. For Mozilla, this is a long term bet on a standards-driven future for WebExtensions.
  * This is broadly a very good read for the benefits of Manifest v3. The discussion about Event Pages, ServiceWorker and backgrounding is an interesting read too. I love Service Workers and Web Workers but I still feel there should be another area to interact with DOM API's if there isn't a commitment from the Web-side of the spec world to bring more compute into workers.
