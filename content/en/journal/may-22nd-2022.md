* Created [No Face](https://no-face.vercel.app/) - It's a simple [Web App](../entry/web-app) that quickly detects and hides people's faces. It's inspired by Casey Liss' Maskerade iOS App. I wanted to see how easy it was to build... We've got a Web API for [FaceDetection](../entry/facedetection), right? [#](#628a279b-4839-404b-8775-bc70004f25a1)<a name="628a279b-4839-404b-8775-bc70004f25a1"></a>
  * It's built using [SvelteKit](../entry/sveltekit) and is based on an earlier project [GitHub - jecfish/mosaic-it](https://github.com/jecfish/mosaic-it) that [Jecelyn Yeen](../entry/jecelyn-yeen), [Eiji Kitamura](../entry/eiji-kitamura) and myself made. [#](#628b57e3-4123-45df-a036-d7e20279d19a)<a name="628b57e3-4123-45df-a036-d7e20279d19a"></a>
  * I thought the [FaceDetection](../entry/facedetection) API was fully launched. It's not it seems. It's a bit of a mess of a situation. We designed this API at least 3 years ago (maybe 4) and it's still not available or ever likely to be if you ask me. Details here: [The Shape Detection API: a picture is worth a thousand words, faces, and barcodes](https://web.dev/shape-detection/) [#](#628b56e4-0840-4c5a-95bd-13752c0d05a9)<a name="628b56e4-0840-4c5a-95bd-13752c0d05a9"></a>
    * The situation with half shipped Fugu API's is mightly frustrating. [#](#628b5a21-5b81-4419-b015-760da8e28407)<a name="628b5a21-5b81-4419-b015-760da8e28407"></a>
    * TODO Speak to the team to see what we can do about finishing what's been started, or can we even stop? [#](#628b5a32-cb92-4de1-9552-fad053912678)<a name="628b5a32-cb92-4de1-9552-fad053912678"></a>
  * I went with TensorFlow JS Face detection API [tfjs-models/face-detection at master · tensorflow/tfjs-models · GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/face-detection) [#](#628b573c-5185-40a5-8701-630abf2c581c)<a name="628b573c-5185-40a5-8701-630abf2c581c"></a>
    * It uses [MediaPipe](../entry/mediapipe) (a google Vision project) under the hood and is a convenience wrapper over it. I wasted 3 hours trying to get MediaPipe to build on the web thinking it would be more efficient. I could not get it working and there is 0 help or support. It might be reasonable to use in production if you can get it to work, but I personally wouldn't rely on it. [#](#628b5758-86f4-47a5-85cf-90d11d661b7a)<a name="628b5758-86f4-47a5-85cf-90d11d661b7a"></a>
    * I reverted back to [Tensorflow JS](../entry/tensorflow-js) and it was set up to get [MediaPipe](../entry/mediapipe) running it had it's own problems. There is 0 guidance about how to get this running in a production environment. For both projects it's 'codepen' examples that pulling from jsdeliver (or another CDN) and there is no thoughts about how to get this running in a build environment. It turns out that [esbuild](../entry/esbuild) was stripping out code it thought was dead and I had to build the dependency with custom parameters. [#](#628b58b8-8c6d-4623-a8a9-e0778ba9f32e)<a name="628b58b8-8c6d-4623-a8a9-e0778ba9f32e"></a>
  * [SvelteKit](../entry/sveltekit) uses [vite](../entry/vite) under the hood, and at a basic level the documentation and project is sound. But I kept hitting edges that stalled any progress. The dead code elimination above was one such example. The [Tensorflow JS](../entry/tensorflow-js) library just doesn't seem to work well with bundlers and minifiers and I can't really change any of it so I have to work out to force it in. [#](#628b5927-f594-4247-a7b6-547d9102649d)<a name="628b5927-f594-4247-a7b6-547d9102649d"></a>
    * TODO  speak to the Tensorflow JS team to see if they can test this more with production systems and build tools that developers use. [#](#628b59c4-5c10-4166-a053-0f435c90c778)<a name="628b59c4-5c10-4166-a053-0f435c90c778"></a>
  * I found it hard to find any guides about working with [SvelteKit](../entry/sveltekit) and [vite](../entry/vite). There's certainly things out there, and the Github Issue tracker is very active, but I was hoping to find something that would guide me along a little more.
