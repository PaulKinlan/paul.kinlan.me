* I was building a very simple site that made use of just plain old semantic HTML and no fancy styling or a need of a 'framework' for tables or columns, it's just a dynamic document and for the life of my my Google-fu failed me, so I asked a question on Twitter about needing a [simple CSS frameworks](https://twitter.com/Paul_Kinlan/status/1560769014787411969) - I'm very happy Twitter exists for questions like this. I couldn't think of the term that I wanted, but I had a vague notion of needing something that replaces the default stylesheet that the browser would apply (and I remember seeing one styled for Tufte). It turns out it's called no-class or [Classless CSS](../entry/classless-css)< I'll keep that page up to date as I find more.

  * I built a site to make it easier to compare the output of each in one place https://classless-css-demo.deno.dev/ , code here: https://github.com/PaulKinlan/classless-css-demo [#](#630386c9-f9a0-4657-88a2-e2bbdb563551)<a name="630386c9-f9a0-4657-88a2-e2bbdb563551"></a>

  * I managed to finally get back to playing with Deno. It's good. Very very good. [#](#6303476a-ed4a-41ab-bd0c-d678a01d8a2f)<a name="6303476a-ed4a-41ab-bd0c-d678a01d8a2f"></a>
  * For me, Deno Deploy is what Vercel once was. Quite happy so far with it. It just feels like building a web app. [#](#63034780-0873-43a4-85c7-e35b77df5fab)<a name="63034780-0873-43a4-85c7-e35b77df5fab"></a>
