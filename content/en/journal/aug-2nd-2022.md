* Read [Tailwind CSS v3.0 â€“ Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3)
  * I get that people don't like tailwind from a purist CSS abstraction POV, but it's got lots of stuff that just kinda work and is just kinda easy.
* Thinking - Related to above, I'm just not happy with the style of my blog and I'm looking to find someone to help with a make-over.
* Blast from the past - 2001. I started a company many many years ago, and this was our home page https://web.archive.org/web/20010119103900/http://www.pcbware.co.uk/ - we were Perl mongers :D We had almost no customers and no actual business, and my pal Chris stayed on to make a proper business out of it and has done very well in the process. I am very proud of him.
