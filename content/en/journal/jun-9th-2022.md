* Thought: (this won't make sense to anyone reading :D) [#](#62bee4d8-274d-4b53-bf74-657c6b166af5)<a name="62bee4d8-274d-4b53-bf74-657c6b166af5"></a>
  * I saw a demo of replacing a media stream from the camera and transforming it with [MediaStreamTrackGenerator - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrackGenerator) and [MediaStreamTrackProcessor - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrackProcessor)  and it blew my mind and made me think about permissions and trust on the web.

    * Lock down your site so it has no permissions and can't request something like Camera access? [Zero Permission] sites. [#](#62bee4d8-cbe8-4a52-8a2d-3a97ded83b09)<a name="62bee4d8-cbe8-4a52-8a2d-3a97ded83b09"></a>
    * There is one site on the web that you trust to use the camera. The user opens that window and makes a camera stream, maybe it morphs the video too, puts some AR filters on it and then pipes it to the Window?

    * Transform stream to get Web Cam access and postMessage back to the calling app. [#](#62bee4d8-bc50-4b93-b108-766d3ecf69a4)<a name="62bee4d8-bc50-4b93-b108-766d3ecf69a4"></a>
      * [streams/transferable-streams-explainer.md at main · whatwg/streams · GitHub](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/blob/main/transferable-streams-explainer.md) [#](#62bee4d8-90fb-4f2c-9aaf-e23e242b4f59)<a name="62bee4d8-90fb-4f2c-9aaf-e23e242b4f59"></a>
    * Does this work? Are all the pieces in place? [#](#62bee4d8-7c4c-4614-b496-093bcc55d83b)<a name="62bee4d8-7c4c-4614-b496-093bcc55d83b"></a>
    * The other side of this is - you could provide a Stream Manipulation service so you don't have to import all the code to your page. [#](#62bee4d8-6422-4574-9c30-d1b05cf21ef6)<a name="62bee4d8-6422-4574-9c30-d1b05cf21ef6"></a>
      * You could have a control panel for web apps that puts a BRB up on the video stream? [#](#62bee4d8-1a96-4bdc-9f26-5652b9625784)<a name="62bee4d8-1a96-4bdc-9f26-5652b9625784"></a>
* Thought: Dieter Bohn posited "what's the next wow moment for the web?", I then asked my team and [Rachel Andrew](../entry/rachel-andrew) asked "for users or developers"? Both I suppose. [#](#62bee4d8-72b2-40ce-9e13-b7525935eddd)<a name="62bee4d8-72b2-40ce-9e13-b7525935eddd"></a>
  * I had two different thoughts in my head about what made me go Wow in the past [#](#62bee4d8-f894-4004-a004-07fc17b7ceea)<a name="62bee4d8-f894-4004-a004-07fc17b7ceea"></a>
  * As a develoepr - MessageChannel API, I can pass these pipes through pipes and it opened my mind to a completely different way to build web sites. [#](#62bee4d8-66ed-4fb6-91f0-373428fe487d)<a name="62bee4d8-66ed-4fb6-91f0-373428fe487d"></a>
  * As a user was video conferencing on the web [#](#62bee4d8-c4b8-4a69-8288-514d1162b090)<a name="62bee4d8-c4b8-4a69-8288-514d1162b090"></a>
  * There are lots of other moments, but they were the first two I picked out. [#](#62bee4d8-023c-4b8b-81b5-3e738ad495d5)<a name="62bee4d8-023c-4b8b-81b5-3e738ad495d5"></a>
  * Reflecting more, seeing Squoosh was another as a user and a developer. [#](#62bee4d8-9ccb-4e26-9d4a-73fe65b09c75)<a name="62bee4d8-9ccb-4e26-9d4a-73fe65b09c75"></a>
  * When restaurants opened after COVID and I just paid and left with a QR code and Google Pay (kinda imagine how seamless it is with Apple Pay). [#](#62bee4d8-345f-406e-a74f-ce4bb9c454ac)<a name="62bee4d8-345f-406e-a74f-ce4bb9c454ac"></a>
