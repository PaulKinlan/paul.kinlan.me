* Thought: (this won't make sense to anyone reading :D) [#](#62a12af7-a88b-465f-b595-989dfdb66906)<a name="62a12af7-a88b-465f-b595-989dfdb66906"></a>
  * I saw a demo of replacing a media stream from the camera and transforming it with [MediaStreamTrackGenerator - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrackGenerator) and [MediaStreamTrackProcessor - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrackProcessor)  and it blew my mind and made me think about permissions and trust on the web.

    * Lock down your site so it has no permissions and can't request something like Camera access? [Zero Permission] sites. [#](#62a1bf98-8f11-4a6f-9190-92824a07bf34)<a name="62a1bf98-8f11-4a6f-9190-92824a07bf34"></a>
    * There is one site on the web that you trust to use the camera. The user opens that window and makes a camera stream, maybe it morphs the video too, puts some AR filters on it and then pipes it to the Window?

    * Transform stream to get Web Cam access and postMessage back to the calling app. [#](#62a1be60-a52c-4db4-b5b2-c34019a28e80)<a name="62a1be60-a52c-4db4-b5b2-c34019a28e80"></a>
      * [streams/transferable-streams-explainer.md at main · whatwg/streams · GitHub](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/blob/main/transferable-streams-explainer.md) [#](#62a1e18a-07ef-432d-ae8b-6b1f86341fba)<a name="62a1e18a-07ef-432d-ae8b-6b1f86341fba"></a>
    * Does this work? Are all the pieces in place? [#](#62a1e1bd-fef6-44c0-bcc8-06b7f1aee596)<a name="62a1e1bd-fef6-44c0-bcc8-06b7f1aee596"></a>
    * The other side of this is - you could provide a Stream Manipulation service so you don't have to import all the code to your page. [#](#62a1e1fc-703b-475e-8a6e-a258330717f0)<a name="62a1e1fc-703b-475e-8a6e-a258330717f0"></a>
      * You could have a control panel for web apps that puts a BRB up on the video stream? [#](#62a1e21d-6ca5-483b-88b8-101d327682ae)<a name="62a1e21d-6ca5-483b-88b8-101d327682ae"></a>
* Thought: Dieter Bohn posited "what's the next wow moment for the web?", I then asked my team and [Rachel Andrew](../entry/rachel-andrew) asked "for users or developers"? Both I suppose. [#](#62a1ca9f-7cb1-411b-b0d5-5f373fe09729)<a name="62a1ca9f-7cb1-411b-b0d5-5f373fe09729"></a>
  * I had two different thoughts in my head about what made me go Wow in the past [#](#62a1e6c0-78b9-4180-b09f-c4bc4a6d7fe5)<a name="62a1e6c0-78b9-4180-b09f-c4bc4a6d7fe5"></a>
  * As a develoepr - MessageChannel API, I can pass these pipes through pipes and it opened my mind to a completely different way to build web sites. [#](#62a1e6d2-ac87-4a7c-b106-856370dd70a3)<a name="62a1e6d2-ac87-4a7c-b106-856370dd70a3"></a>
  * As a user was video conferencing on the web [#](#62a1e6d7-72af-4194-8ad9-a590209d0836)<a name="62a1e6d7-72af-4194-8ad9-a590209d0836"></a>
  * There are lots of other moments, but they were the first two I picked out. [#](#62a1e6eb-ae20-4a4e-8011-7b62d74994fa)<a name="62a1e6eb-ae20-4a4e-8011-7b62d74994fa"></a>
  * Reflecting more, seeing Squoosh was another as a user and a developer. [#](#62a1e832-5d97-4de2-950e-67800154c27c)<a name="62a1e832-5d97-4de2-950e-67800154c27c"></a>
  * When restaurants opened after COVID and I just paid and left with a QR code and Google Pay (kinda imagine how seamless it is with Apple Pay). [#](#62a1f032-56b2-4f21-ae1c-296595c17257)<a name="62a1f032-56b2-4f21-ae1c-296595c17257"></a>
