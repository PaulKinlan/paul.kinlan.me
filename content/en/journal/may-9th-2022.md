* [I'm a fucking webmaster](https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/)
  * Loved this. Brought back a lot of memories.
* [GRAND THEFT AUTO 1996 Making Of - GTA - | Retro Gaming | BBC Archive - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vWSi44ZTSw)
  * I just love a good dive in to how things were made. It's not long or particularly deep video but it's nice to watch and the accents are beautiful
* [The realtime web: evolution of the user experience | Ably Blog: Data in Motion](https://ably.com/blog/the-realtime-web-evolution-of-the-user-experience)
  * I thought this was just an interesting summary of how the web has changed from a request-response medium to a fully interactive medium
* [GitHub - naptha/tesseract.js: Pure Javascript OCR for more than 100 Languages ðŸ“–ðŸŽ‰ðŸ–¥](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js)
  * [Mosaic It](https://mosaic-it.vercel.app/) [Jecelyn Yeen](../entry/jecelyn-yeen), [Eiji Kitamura](../entry/eiji-kitamura) and I built this as a demo for a hackathon. We trialed [SvelteKit](../entry/sveltekit) and had a delightful time with it. Code: [GitHub - jecfish/mosaic-it](https://github.com/jecfish/mosaic-it)
* [The next chapter for Cloudflare Workers: open source](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-open-source-announcement/)
  * I was pleasantly surprised to see this. Amazing. ServiceWorkers can be everywhere, on the edge, on the app, everywhere. I wonder if this will be like a kubernetes momment?
* https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev/status/1523649365159591936
  * We have a fund for Advanced Applications and the ecosystem around it.
* [Apple WebXR: Web-based AR doesnâ€™t work on iPhones - Protocol](https://www.protocol.com/entertainment/apple-webxr-ar-ios-iphone)
  * Interesting read. I don't really have an opinion, I'm personally not bullish on AR in general, but my time in this space might have passed, but as always I don't think long-term successful platforms can be locked in to installed-apps.
