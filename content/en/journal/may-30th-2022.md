* Last week was a busy week with not much time to read. I'm going back to the USA for the 2nd time in three weeks and I'm struggling to find how to get the COVID test when my flight is at 7am and the testing unit opens at 7am. Turns out telehealth is a big thing and it's powered by [WebRTC](../entry/webrtc) [#](#629498bd-e385-4574-8a35-644eb5800ff9)<a name="629498bd-e385-4574-8a35-644eb5800ff9"></a>
* Read [The rise of the extensible app platforms](https://blog.almaer.com/the-rise-of-the-extensible-app-platforms/) [#](#629498ad-45a9-4035-962c-15ef9e74f6d7)<a name="629498ad-45a9-4035-962c-15ef9e74f6d7"></a>
  * I've been doing a lot of thinking in this space recently, so the timing is very apropos. [#](#629498fd-5f50-418e-8a33-eeba76fc8bd7)<a name="629498fd-5f50-418e-8a33-eeba76fc8bd7"></a>
  * Naturally you think about Chrome Extensions extending the browser and empowering users, but there's also a lot of other platforms in the browser itself: [Chrome DevTools](../entry/chrome-devtools) is one example, you can build your own tooling to extend and enhance your developer offerings. [Lighthouse](../entry/lighthouse) has plugins and [Stackpacks](../entry/stackpacks) that developers can build. [Chrome DevTools Protocol](../entry/chrome-devtools-protocol) and [Puppeteer](../entry/puppeteer) are two other [#](#62949a2d-6a08-4f4a-94d1-65c65e6a9970)<a name="62949a2d-6a08-4f4a-94d1-65c65e6a9970"></a>
  * Vercel is another example that I've seen recently [Find an Integration – Vercel](https://vercel.com/integrations) [#](#62949a2f-2b33-4441-8720-bdc28f93df37)<a name="62949a2f-2b33-4441-8720-bdc28f93df37"></a>

  * I found this quite interesting. In my mind it relates to things like [Core Web Vitals](../entry/core-web-vitals), there's guidelines and hints and tips. I do wonder if this is just aspirational though or if it can be made more concrete...? [#](#62949a5b-82e8-4753-8520-82addd8f2fce)<a name="62949a5b-82e8-4753-8520-82addd8f2fce"></a>

  * There's lots to read in here and I'd recommend it. One thing stuck out: "Outreach and guides to help you navigate in the evolving ecosystem" - we see in our developer surveys that people are just struggling to keep up.

  * This is such a great post. I love where the experimentation with Datasette has gone and I follow it. I built a demo similar when I was working in Fraud Detection so I have a soft spot for this. [#](#6294bbff-c65f-4133-bc4f-d267aed1793a)<a name="6294bbff-c65f-4133-bc4f-d267aed1793a"></a>

  * "I ended up figuring out that running Datasette in Pyodide in a web worker was the best strategy. Web workers allow JavaScript web applications to run CPU intensive code in a separate process, such that they won’t block the main browser UI thread. Running Python in WebAssembly is exactly the kind of thing they are good for!" - I just love the fact that people are pushing Web Workers again.
