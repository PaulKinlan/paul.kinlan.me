* Last week was a busy week with not much time to read. I'm going back to the USA for the 2nd time in three weeks and I'm struggling to find how to get the COVID test when my flight is at 7am and the testing unit opens at 7am. Turns out telehealth is a big thing and it's powered by [WebRTC](../entry/webrtc)
* Read [The rise of the extensible app platforms](https://blog.almaer.com/the-rise-of-the-extensible-app-platforms/)
  * I've been doing a lot of thinking in this space recently, so the timing is very apropos.
  * Naturally you think about Chrome Extensions extending the browser and empowering users, but there's also a lot of other platforms in the browser itself: [Chrome DevTools](../entry/chrome-devtools) is one example, you can build your own tooling to extend and enhance your developer offerings. [Lighthouse](../entry/lighthouse) has plugins and [Stackpacks](../entry/stackpacks) that developers can build. [Chrome DevTools Protocol](../entry/chrome-devtools-protocol) and [Puppeteer](../entry/puppeteer) are two other
  * Vercel is another example that I've seen recently [Find an Integration – Vercel](https://vercel.com/integrations)
* Read https://developer.android.com/quality
  * I found this quite interesting. In my mind it relates to things like [Core Web Vitals](../entry/core-web-vitals), there's guidelines and hints and tips. I do wonder if this is just aspirational though or if it can be made more concrete...?
* Read [GOV.UK drops jQuery from their front end.](https://web.dev/gov-uk-drops-jquery/)
  * I love this, I hope we can do more of these types of posts to help raising the voices of the great work in the community.
* Read [Chromium Blog: Chrome 103 Beta: Early Navigation Hints, a Host of Completed Origin Trials, and More](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/05/chrome-103-beta-early-navigation-hints.html)
  * I love the progress that we see in Chrome, but trying to build a story around the API's that launch and when.... well, that's impossible :D
* Read [Angular’s Vision for the Future. In the Angular 2021 recap and 2022… | by Madleina Scheidegger | May, 2022 | Angular Blog](https://blog.angular.io/angulars-vision-for-the-future-3cfca5e7b448)
  * There's lots to read in here and I'd recommend it. One thing stuck out: "Outreach and guides to help you navigate in the evolving ecosystem" - we see in our developer surveys that people are just struggling to keep up.
* Read [Arc Note: Datasette - Simon Willison](https://architecturenotes.co/datasette-simon-willison/)
  * This is such a great post. I love where the experimentation with Datasette has gone and I follow it. I built a demo similar when I was working in Fraud Detection so I have a soft spot for this.
  * TODO read https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/
  * "I ended up figuring out that running Datasette in Pyodide in a web worker was the best strategy. Web workers allow JavaScript web applications to run CPU intensive code in a separate process, such that they won’t block the main browser UI thread. Running Python in WebAssembly is exactly the kind of thing they are good for!" - I just love the fact that people are pushing [Web Workers](../entry/web-workers) again.
  * Read [The Baked Data architectural pattern](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/)
* Followed https://architecturenotes.co/
  * After reading the Datasette post, I've followed this. I love these dives and I wanted to start something similar in the past. I can't wait to read more.
* Read [Google I/O 2022 Urges Developers to Focus on the &#8216;Real World&#8217; &#8211; The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/google-i-o-2022-urges-developers-to-focus-on-the-real-world/)
  * Real-world. Kinda nice to see some of the themes we've been working around are getting picked up.
* Read [Core Web Vitals Study 2022 - tl;dr Marketing](https://tldrmarketing.com/seo/core-web-vitals-study-2022/) - just an interesting read.
* Read [Lesser-Known And Underused CSS Features In 2022 — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/lesser-known-underused-css-features-2022/)
  * TIL on most of these.
* Read [As a user, I prefer static HTML pages over web &quot;apps&quot;. : webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/v0yp0v/as_a_user_i_prefer_static_html_pages_over_web_apps/)
* Read [Just How Long Should Alt Text Be?](https://css-tricks.com/just-how-long-should-alt-text-be/)
  * This post was a good read and it raised up one of the issues I have, I get so nervous around things like Alt Text that I end up doing it less than I should.
* Read [More thoughts on SPAs | Read the Tea Leaves](https://nolanlawson.com/2022/05/25/more-thoughts-on-spas/) - Amazing Read from Nolan Lawson
