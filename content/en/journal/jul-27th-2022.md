* Read [Launching Instagram Messaging on desktop - Engineering at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/26/web/launching-instagram-messaging-on-desktop/)
  * > Furthermore, we havenâ€™t found any evidence that the Instagram desktop web experience cannibalizes engagement from the native apps. In fact, itâ€™s quite the opposite â€” users who use both interfaces spend more time on each interface, compared to users who use each interface exclusively.
* Read [Fantastic CSS border animation - DEV Community](https://dev.to/chokcoco/fantastic-css-border-animation-5166)
  * Very very cool.
* Watched [Hexaflexagons - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIVIegSt81k&list=PLaNzoFtkQ7rbt5ac9qdi76iNKuqZWQkB3) ðŸ¤¯
* Updated [GitHub - PaulKinlan/logseq-webpage-title](https://github.com/PaulKinlan/logseq-webpage-title) to have shortcut commands
* Read [mobile-drag-drop - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobile-drag-drop)
  * Drag and drop support is getting better, but it's been at least 10 years of hell.
* Read https://www.autoregex.xyz/
  * All the demos are wrong. Please don't use this tool. e.g 
> Match all characters before the sequence "xyz" (do not include "xyz")
 `>> [^xyz]*`
The above code matches `abcx`, `abcy`, `abcz`... and is not the intent of the english input.
* Tested [Testing Playground](https://testing-playground.com/)
  * Very very very cool
* Used [cssgr.id | An interactive CSS Grid code tool and generator](https://cssgr.id/)
  * YES!!
