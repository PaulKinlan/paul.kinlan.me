* The USA was off on national holiday today, so I spent some time investigating what you can do with [Browser Compat Data](../entry/browser-compat-data)
  * Built [Now Stable across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari](https://time-to-stable.deno.dev/when-stable?browser-chrome=on&browser-firefox=on&browser-safari=on&feature-api=on&feature-css=on&feature-html=on&feature-javascript=on) - to help us work out what is new to the web each month.
  * Built [Time to Stable](https://time-to-stable.deno.dev/) - To help us how long it takes features to reach a stable portion of the web
    * Test: [Time to Stable across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari](https://time-to-stable.deno.dev/?browser-chrome=on&browser-firefox=on&browser-safari=on&feature-api=on&feature-css=on&feature-html=on&feature-javascript=on)
