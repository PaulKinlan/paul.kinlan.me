* It was a long week off and I didn't do much reading.
* Read [New to the web platform in May](https://web.dev/web-platform-05-2022/)
  * We're starting a longer arc of focusing on what is practically available and more visibility about where things are available. Very happy to see posts like this coming together
* Read [Meet Web Push | WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/12945/meet-web-push/)
  * "Violations of the userVisibleOnly promise will result in a push subscription being revoked." - I wonder how that is determined.
  * "From WebKitâ€™s perspective, supporting Web Push requires deep per-platform and per-application customization" - `webpusd` for MacOS, it's certainly a similar story to how Chrome landed push notifications, incremental across the platforms.
* I'm at an offsite and there's a lot of conversation about [A11Y](../entry/a11y) and these were some of the links I managed to capture during the conversation.
