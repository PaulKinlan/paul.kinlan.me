  * Amazing to see more events coming back, but also this one had passed me by in previous years so it was great to get some visibility of it (and also the copious notes). I'm always amazed about the intersection of where the web and browsers meet - in this case the [Enterprise Web](../entry/enterprise-web) and the [Hardware Web](../entry/hardware-web) as two examples.

  * There are lots of people building component libraries and I'm unsure about why I don't see more information. For example, Alaska Airlines has a component library: [Auro Design System | Alaska Airlines | Seattle, WA](https://auro.alaskaair.com/#gsc.tab=0,) ING bank too [GitHub - ing-bank/lion: Fundamental white label web component features for your design system.](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion) :mind-blown: [#](#62ba1da4-1d38-48fb-ba86-214045237ef8)<a name="62ba1da4-1d38-48fb-ba86-214045237ef8"></a>
