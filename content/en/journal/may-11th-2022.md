  * This was a great thread about Storage on the web and how much of a game changer it is, but it missed a couple of points. Adoption is not because developers don't care, it's because UA have not solved their need.
    * Lack of consistency across browsers - which browser have what storage and for how long.
    * It's not persistent persistently :D the browser can evict it whenever it wants.
      * Actually I could swear Safari will drop it after 7 days of no usage.
    * Actual persistent persistence is gated behind arbitrary user gestures like a bookmark
      * [Persistent storage](https://web.dev/persistent-storage/)
      * How high is the level of site engagement? Has the site been installed or bookmarked? Has the site been granted permission to show notifications?... What??? Seriously??
      * I can't rely on this... (is what developers say)
    * Browser vendors are hesitant of super-cookies (rightly)
