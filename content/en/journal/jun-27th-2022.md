* Used [Platformer Toolkit by Game Maker's Toolkit](https://gmtk.itch.io/platformer-toolkit) - I'm loving this, very hands on and approachable way to learn about game development that's not "here's a triangle"
  * Played [Emily Blaster](https://gabriellezevin.com/emilyblastergame) - in the same conversations our team was having, this game came up. I love how instantly accessible games on the web are.
* Read [browsers.fyi](https://browsers.fyi) - check the feed too https://www.browsers.fyi/feed/
* Read [Attribution Reporting updates in June 2022 - Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/attribution-reporting-updates-june-2022/)
* Read [Apple Is Not Defending Browser Engine Choice - Infrequently Noted](https://infrequently.org/2022/06/apple-is-not-defending-browser-engine-choice/)
* There was people on the Fugu team talking about [VEXcode V5](https://codev5.vex.com/) & https://www.stemplayer.com/ - great to see.
  * Someone should make a list of physical products that can now be attached to the web.
