  * Great web site built by a part of the Chrome team that explains media a little more and has some interactive demos integrated in. [#](#62ba1da4-9b2d-4eb8-b57d-1b6402dedbf1)<a name="62ba1da4-9b2d-4eb8-b57d-1b6402dedbf1"></a>

  * I'm very glad they have pricing, but I'm looking at it and I'm like, damn, I can't even experiment. [#](#62ba1da4-db5f-414f-9b39-5342e949e1ea)<a name="62ba1da4-db5f-414f-9b39-5342e949e1ea"></a>
    * The ideas that I can come up with are all fun interactive kind of things and I'd hate to get on the end of a HN stampeded. [#](#62ba1da4-3beb-4007-a583-f44a3c71f48a)<a name="62ba1da4-3beb-4007-a583-f44a3c71f48a"></a>
    * "browser profile identifier" - wonder how that works (or will work) as all of the browsers try to move to a world with less profiling. [#](#62ba1da4-3677-490d-998d-625fce6f6c8f)<a name="62ba1da4-3677-490d-998d-625fce6f6c8f"></a>
  * Your app is built as a replicache app - it's not like you just hook it in and it takes your local state and syncs it, you have to build it knowing that you will structure your app that way. It's not a bad thing per-se, but you are locked in to it. [#](#62ba1da4-8eff-40f1-88ba-621847d29219)<a name="62ba1da4-8eff-40f1-88ba-621847d29219"></a>

    * > Moreover, an important characteristic of CRDTs is that they support decentralised operation: they do not assume the use of a single server, so they can be used in peer-to-peer networks and other decentralised settings. In this regard CRDTs differ from the algorithms used by Google Docs, Trello, and Figma, which require all communication between users to flow via a server.
