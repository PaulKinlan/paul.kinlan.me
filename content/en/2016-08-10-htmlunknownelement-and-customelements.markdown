Originally I thought that custom elements, [HTMLUnknownElement](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#htmlunknownelement)

> The HTMLUnknownElement interface must be used for HTML elements that are not defined by this specification
> (or other applicable specifications).

Any element on the page that is not one defined in the spec

> Create a node implementing the interface appropriate for the element type corresponding to the tag name of the
> token in given namespace (as given in the specification that defines that element, e.g., for an a element in
> the HTML namespace, this specification defines it to be the HTMLAnchorElement interface), with the tag name
> being the name of that element, with the node being in the given namespace, and with the attributes on the node
> being those given in the given token.

```
interface HTMLUnknownElement : HTMLElement { };
```

An Unknown element is a `HTMLElement` with no additional attributes which implies at that level
it is equivalent to a `<span>` element (
http://w3c.github.io/html/textlevel-semantics.html#elementdef-span)

```
interface HTMLSpanElement : HTMLElement { };
```

So in short, `<anyrandom>tag</anyrandom>` is equivalent to a `<span>` element. It turns out that this is a great
building block (at least from IE9 upwards).


* Tightly defined contracts for UI elements





Semantics as elements.

There is an opportunity for the components that developers use are developed and
managed outside of the browser space we can get to a place where component
suites, meta-platforms and other

`<responsive-image>`

Because all of the AMP Components are pretty well defined and specced out a
third party platform could take the well defined AMP document and render it in
their own web experience (like Google do with their rendering of AMP content in
the carousel) but replace the `<amp-*>` implementation with their own
implementation of the elements.

I think this is an interesting possibility because if you extend it further


* Components will only control it's self and the elements in it's scope. We need
  to ensure that there are no side effects.
