The MSN Search API's are up. Yay!<p />I have not had much time to look at it just yet, but I have some links for you.<p />Why MSN Search? <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/msnsearch/whysearch/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/msnsearch/whysearch/</a><br />MSN Search API Download: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C271309B-02DE-42A7-B23E-E19F68667197&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C271309B-02DE-42A7-B23E-E19F68667197&amp;displaylang=en</a><p />As far as I can tell the search API is a SOA0P service [<a href="http://soap.search.msn.com/webservices.asmx?wsdl">http://soap.search.msn.com/webservices.asmx?wsdl</a>], so no direct calls from IE it seems, and it looks like I will have to create a proxy forwarding kit :) ala My yahoo ones. :)<p />The download includes some documentation and some sample projects and you have to obtain an application ID which appears to be like the Yahoo Application ID.  The forms can be found here: <a href="http://search.msn.com/developer">http://search.msn.com/developer</a> and it looks like you need a .Net Passport.<p />If anyone knows how to consume SOAP in JavaScript let me know.  <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a><p />
