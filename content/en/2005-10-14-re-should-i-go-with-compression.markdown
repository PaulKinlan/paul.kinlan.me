Following a [comment ](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/10/should-i-go-with-compression.html#c112908078131661908)on my blog from <a href="http://blog.sublogic.com/">James Manning<br /></a><blockquote>
<br /><div>It should be pretty straightforward. With 2.0 there's built-in support for decompression of SOAP replies. Check out the article that got posted last year @ [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=)/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/wsnetfx2.asp</div>

However, it is really handy to know because it might be of use with Amazons API's which do have a SOAP interface.<p />
