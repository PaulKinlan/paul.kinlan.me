I have updated my tag directory, it now includes Amazon product data.  It pulls data from the Amazon AWS (Books currently) that are related to the tag in the tag directory.  I am thinking of putting images in, but currently it just adds links.<p />It is another Web 2.0 API to add to this Mashup.  Now it include:<ul>
<li>Amazon AWS</li>
<li>Del.icio.us</li>
<li>Yahoo Search API</li>
<li>Google Blog Search RSS Results</li>

</ul>Check it out some examples <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/RDF" rel="tag">RDF</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/RSS" rel="tag">RSS</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/Mashup" rel="tag">Mashup</a><p />
