I am currently working on a little AJAX application.  Over the past few weeks, with each blog entry that I have written I have struggled to keep the Technorati Tags, Feedster and MSN search boxes up todate, with the AJAX application I will automatically be able to generate these information boxes with relevant tags and searches.<p />Basically it is a JavaScript only Webservice queryer.  The client side parses the results and uses these results as the input for another webservice..... It's all about integration! :)<p />Currently it only supports Internet Explorer (IE7, and IE6), Firefox support is lacking at the moment, purely because I cannot import datasources from sites other than the current domain.  I think this is a major downer really.  I am quite restriced with what I can do in Firefox, but I suppose that is part and partial of the secure nature of the project.  I have read about some JavaScript code signing that might work; I am yet to investigate this route though.<p />Currently the AJAX appliction integrates with Yahoo webservices.  But it will integrate in to technorati too.  I am hoping also that I can find some developer support at Feedster and see what I can do with their systems.<p />I need to iron out some "Key" security issues that I have, I don't particularly want to have to show the public my Yahoo! key but If I must, I must.<p />I hope to get I prototype up tonight so that people can break it.  And I can get feed back.<p />More a little later.  Hopefully the tags below will be generated by this tool!<br />
