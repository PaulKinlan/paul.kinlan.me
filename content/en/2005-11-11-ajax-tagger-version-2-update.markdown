I have been updating AJAX Tagger version 2 (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">AJAXTag</a>) recently and I am starting to use it properly now for each post.<p />Some of the features:<br /><ul>
<li>Extensivly uses the Yahoo, Amazon, Flickr and Technorati API's all web 2.0 and the like</li>
<li>It also finds related wikipedia articles and related articles that the user has on their own site.</li>
<li>All AJAX Based</li>
<li>Uses a special Request queue algorithm</li>
<li>Generates an OPML output and HTML outptut.</li>
<li>Generates a listing of amazon realted products.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer Only at the moment, sorry.</li>
</ul><br />Check it out over on <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2</a>. And tell me what you think.<p />The UI and intercation needs to be sorted but that shouldn't be hard.<p />
