I have found a couple more thanks to this site: [http://www.momathome.com/](http://www.momathome.com/viewfromhome/2005/10/social_bookmarking_simple_just.php).<p />There is Shadows, Simpy, Del.icio.us and BlinkList [although the latters site is not working].  Are there any more?<blockquote>
<div>I am looking for services that are similar to del.icio.us so that I can add them to my AJAX based DeliTag. I am thinking that I can upload the tags to Del.icio.us and other services in one go.<p />
</div>
