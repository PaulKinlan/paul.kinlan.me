Speaking about Perl in my Previous post, I forgot to mention that I will need to start doing some XML processing, before I start going off and investigating the wrong XML Parsers does anyone know of a good lightweight Perl XML Parser.<p />Some options that I need are:<ol>
<li>It has to be light weight</li>
<li>Potentially support XPath</li>
<li>Has to be a reader (itereates accross nodes) I think this means SAX</li>
<li>Has to also support DOM.</li>
<li>Allows Creation of XML documents, via DOM style methods or some other method which I don't know about.</li>
</ol><p>If you have any suggestions, I really would appreciate hearing them.</p><p>Email me: <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a></p><p />
