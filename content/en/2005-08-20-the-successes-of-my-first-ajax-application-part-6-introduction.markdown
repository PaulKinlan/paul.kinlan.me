This is the sixth installment of my "Success and Failures of my First AJAX application".  If you would like to talk to me about AJAX or anything else email me: <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a><p />This entry is titled: "It got me thinking about how I communicate over my blog".  This focuses on several areas from who I am trying to improve my grammar; the things I talk about; the length of the entries and what I include in my Blogs.<p />I will try to deal with each individual point, but the general gist of this post is really about how I have and I am trying to constantly evolve my blog.<p /><ul>
