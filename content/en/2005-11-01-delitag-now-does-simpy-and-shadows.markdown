title: DeliTag Now Does SIMPY and SHADOWS
published: true
---
I have updated the DeliTag to also upload tags to SIMPY and Shadows. Simpy is great Shadows won't let me get past the CAPTCHA stage. Come on guys sort it out, I want to use your service.<p /><strong>Update: </strong>DeliTag can post to Shadows, but I couldn't create an account due to a problem with CAPTCHA.  I should have made that clearer in the post.<p /><strong>Update 2:</strong>  I have created a shadows account.  I still didn't get past the CAPTCHA Verifcation, but I got a confirmation email.<p /><br />
