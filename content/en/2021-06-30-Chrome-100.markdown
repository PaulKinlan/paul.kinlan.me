Chrome turns 100 soon, actually a fair bit sooner than I had originally thought now that we are on a 4 week release cycle ([estimates are 36 weeks away](https://chromestatus.com/features/schedule)).

I remember stories of how MS skipped Windows 9 because they were worried about a huge number of Apps checking for Windows 95 and Windows 98 by checking for ["Windows 9"](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2hwlrk/new_windows_version_will_be_called_windows_10/ckwq83x/). It could also be just marketing, who knows...

Are developers doing something similar for user agent checking?

I've done a naieve analysis by trawling the HTTP Archive with the following query.

```SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `httparchive.response_bodies.2020_10_01_desktop` response
WHERE
  body LIKE '%Chrome 10%'
  AND url LIKE '%.js%'
```

As expected it finds a lot of results but most of them appear to be comments about work arounds in jQuery and comments about testing in Chrome 10+.

I also created a more specific query to times when people look for 'Chrome' in the user agent string.

```SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `httparchive.response_bodies.2020_10_01_desktop` response
WHERE
  REGEXP_CONTAINS(body, r"userAgent\.indexOf\([\'|\"]Chrome ")
  AND url LIKE '%.js%'
```

This returns just 2 results over the entire corpus of response data in HTTP Archive, both of which are no looking for Chrome versions.

I'm relatively confident that developers are not looking for Chrome 10 in the client, however I'm a blind to what developers do on the server where a lot of user agent sniffing occurs (it's part of the reason for [User Agent Client hints](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/) proposal)
