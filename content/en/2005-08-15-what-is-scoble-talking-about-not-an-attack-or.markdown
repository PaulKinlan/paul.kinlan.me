title: What is Scoble Talking about? [Not an attack or anything]
published: true

I was just reading Robert Scobles Blog Article: <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/15.html#a10851">http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/15.html#a10851</a>.<p />And at the end he makes the following comment:<br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Blogging, though, gets us close -- because it increases the number of sites everyone wants to keep up on. What happens when everyone in your family has a Flickr site and a blog? How many people are in your family? At my wedding there were more than 50 family members and I don't think that's atypical. If you're trying to keep up to date on 50 people email and Web just doesn't cut it. Will you really want to visit your brother's site every few days just to see if he's posted a new picture of his kids?</blockquote><p />What is he talking about?  Is it a nod towards "the really cool thing that will change the face of blogging" that he can't talk about just yet. [Note: If anyone has the link to when he said it, I will post it.  I need to make sure I am not talking guff].<p />If I were to read between the lines [by the way, I nearly always read in to the wrong thing].  I would say that he is implying that there is going to be more of a private social blogging tool.  A system that allows everyone in the family to let everyone in the family know what is going on.  Imagine a site that all your family logs into to let them know about social events, happenings and other family stuff.  Each member blogs, each of the blogs are aggregated?  Maybe the head of the family gets precedence over announcements?  Maybe the kids in the family all see each others blogs without caring about the parents, auntie and uncles blog entries.  Just one site to rule them all?  To talk to anyone else you just write in your blog, referencing another family members blog and a conversation is started.  Imagine the social network analysis that could be done with all this information!<p />Is this feasible? Has it been done before?<p />Any thoughts?
