After having a [little moan](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcom-still-that-minor-issue-exists.html) [the only way I can describe it], two members of the MSN Start.com team got back to my email response.  Basically the gist of what they said is that they are swamped with extra work that they have to do on this project but will be working on the section that handles mouse clicks from events like closing a panel down.  They said that they will probably replace the mouse down event with a mouse up event.<p />That was a good reply from them and it made me very happy :)  Way to go start.com.<p />Here are some of my entries about the subject<p />http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/msn-startcom.html<br />[http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcom-still-that-minor-issue-exists.html](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcom-still-that-minor-issue-exists.html)<br />[http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcom-please-listen.html](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/startcom-please-listen.html)<br />[http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/07/startcom-little-annoyance.html](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/07/startcom-little-annoyance.html)<p />
