summary: A handy list of the podcasts that I listen to.
---

I love podcasts and I listen to quite a few, yet I still find discovering new podcasts is quite a hard process and I rely on friends to share what the listen to. So with that in mind here is my [podroll](https://player.fm/pkinlan/fm.opml). I use [Player.fm](https://player.fm) which is made by my good friend Mike Mahemoff and has the ability to share and export your subscription list.

This page will be [refreshed frequently using my little script](https://github.com/PaulKinlan/paul.kinlan.me/blob/main/podroll.js).
