title: AJAX Tagger Second Question

I am just working on some requriements for the next version of the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">AJAX Tagger</a> application. If any of you could get back to me then I would greatly appreciate your feedback. <p />The reason why I created the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">AJAX Tagger</a> is that it allowed me to add value to my blog entries by linking readers of my blog with other blogs of a very similar topic.  Would you like to be able to have it use different sources rather than <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a>.  For instance would you like it to link to <a href="http://www.icerocket.com">IceRocket</a> etc?  Or is linking to related blog lists not what you want, would you like it to link to a site such as Wikipedia?<p />What I am trying to get at is:  Where would you like the application to create automatically tagged links too?<p />
