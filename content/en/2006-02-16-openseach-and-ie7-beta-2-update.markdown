The Opensearch spec that I wrote the other day was a little inaccurate, thanks to Michael Fagan for the comment.<p /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Nice. I look forward to the day when all blogs offer this.Btw, your<br />ShortName is much longer than 16 characters, the maximum, so you should be using<br />LongName instead. </p>
<p>See <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/spec/1.1/description/#longname">http://opensearch.a9.com/spec/1.1/description/#longname</a><br />. Also, while your OpenSearch Description file is correct, your display on the<br />blog post uses some lowercase characters when they should be in uppercase.<br />Somebody might get confused if they copy that and find out it doesn't<br />work.</p>
</blockquote><p />I have ammended the XML so that it is more in line with the spec and includes along name.  I have also added in a URL for RSS results based off Google's Blog search.<p />One thing it doesn't do is integrate into <a href="http://www.A9.com">http://www.A9.com</a> because the search engine is not on my domain.  It is a pity really, but I can see why they do it.  I could route all the search results through a proxy script but I think that would be even more unfair to Google.<p />
