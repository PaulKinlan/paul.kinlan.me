I just recieved a nice email from [Gaby de Wilde](http://blog.360.yahoo.com/Factuurexpress?p=2011), this is the first person who I don't know directly who has used my [AJAX](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag) Tagger.  He even gave me a link on his site.  <p />Thanks!!  I have taken the feedback and will add some of your suggestions to my requirements for the next version.<p />Anyway, take a trip over to his blog to see my tags in action.<p />If anyone has any suggestions I would greatly appreciate feedback.<p />
