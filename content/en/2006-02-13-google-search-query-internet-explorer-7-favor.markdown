A user visited my site with the Query "internet explorer 7 favorites".  My original content for IE7 favorites was with Beta 1, so I thought that it was only fair that I provided an update not that Beta 2 is on the streets.<p />I had two major problems:<br /><ol>
<li>The favorites menu when open would crash IE7 Beta 1</li>
<li>The favorites menu when extremly large would file the screen and you couldn't see what was happening.</li>
</ol><p>It seems that both of my issues have been fixed in Internet Explorer Beta 2, the menu now doesn't take the entire screen, it works a similar way to the IE 6 browser where it is one long scrollable menu.  And also it doesn't crash anymore. :)</p><p />
