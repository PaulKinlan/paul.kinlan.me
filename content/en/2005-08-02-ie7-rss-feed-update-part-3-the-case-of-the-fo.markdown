I was pretty sure that there are some feeds that get found by IE7 yet don't display correctly if at all in the "Feed View".  If you direct Internet Explorer 7 towards channel9.msdn.com, you should see that it detects a feed is available, now if you try and view the feed all it shows is the XML.<p />Why doesn't it XSLT the feed correctly.  I don't know?  But if you do, let me know.  I am thinking of starting a list of feeds that do not appear to render correctly, it might be a bug, it might not.  But if anyone from Microsoft stumbles accross this site it might help them.<p />If anyone who reads this blog [I know there are at least three people now :)] knows any feeds that don't render drop me an email [<a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a>]<p /><br />
