Robert Scoble [links](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/10.html#a11097) to [some more ](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=08e686db-538c-4464-a96c-67a116595f9c)information about the MSN Search API's.  There is not an amazing amount of extra information in the linked article, however a figure is mentioned about how many queries that you can do with the API.<p />I have broken down some of the figures so that you know what they are in comparison to other Free (Not mentioning Ebay) API's<p />Google: 1000 queuries to the Search API per day<br />Yahoo:  5000 queries to each individual API per day<br />MSN: To be confirmed but it appears to be 10,000 per day [this could be per API or in total]<br />Amazon: 1 query per second = 60 * 60 * 24 = 3600 * 24 = 86,400 per day<p />
