This is not a million miles away from what we do internally, where we have a concept of 'snippets'. It's up to you how you manage it, but it's a great way of keeping track of what you did, but also shared across your team you get a nice picture of what your peers, managers and reports are also doing.

The model I like is to split each weekly summary into a 'what I did' and 'what intend to do this week'. It helps me reflect and plan at the same time.
