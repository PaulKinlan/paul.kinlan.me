I have not messed around with XAML for a while now and was a little rusty, so I decided to get  "Programming: Windows Presentation Foundation" from Amazon [<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1634&amp;tag=cnetfra-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;path=ASIN/0596101139/qid%3D1131541496">UK</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=cnetfra-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=ASIN/0596101139">US</a>], it is pretty neat so far, its examples are in XAML and C# and I am just on the Panels section and it is very well written. <p />The first chapter is pretty much a very quick overview of XAML and what in can do for you, it is kind of lucky that I had a basic understanding because it flys by and would be confusing for beginners.  The Layout (Chapter 2) section so far is pretty good.  I am finding it very interesting, there are simple examples with each of the point that are up for discussion, so it is a nice read.<p />
