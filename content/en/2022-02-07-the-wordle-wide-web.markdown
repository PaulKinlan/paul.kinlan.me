I was idly musing the other month that I've not seen so much hacking on web projects since I started web development back in 97, as I've recently seen with people building around the ideas for web3. 

I was **very** happy to see Wordle, the game created by Josh Wardle, re-introduce what the web is great for to so many new people, both for regular users of the web and developers. It's a fun game, it works well on mobile, it's easy to access (via a link), it's quick to load, it's not loaded with ads, it's easy to use, it's easy to install if you want and not push if you don't, and doesn't hit you with notifications, and it's inspired developers to create similar experiences.

Thank you [Josh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wardle)! (and congratulations on the [sale](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60208463)).

If like me, you found that it was pretty hard to Google for the games, I've listed a couple here:

* [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) (The original)
* [Japanese Wordle](https://taximanli.github.io/kotobade-asobou/) (Kotobade Asobou - [Source code](https://github.com/taximanli/kotobade-asobou)) - I'm quite happy to have outscored my wife a couple of times with one.
* [Welsh Wordle](https://cyrdle.web.app/) (Cyrdle) - My wife and I have just started to learn Welsh, so we will be using this.
* [Norwegian Wordle](https://www.wordle.lol/) (https://twitter.com/WordleNorge)
* [Swedish](https://ordlig.se/)
* [French](https://wordle.louan.me/)
* \[Insert yours here] ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/Paul_Kinlan) at me or [email me](mailto:paulkinlan@google.com) if you have any suggestions)

It's even inspired some variations on the theme:

* [Cross Wordle](https://flackr.github.io/crosswordle/) (by Flackr - [Source](https://github.com/flackr/crosswordle)) - I love this one, but I find it very difficult
* [Absurdle](https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html)
