I was idly musing the other month that I've not seen so much hacking on web projects since I started web development back in 97, as have recently seen with people building around the ideas for web3. I was **very** happy to see Wordle, the game created by Josh Wardle re-introduce what the web is great for to so many new people, both for regular users of the web and developers. It's a fun game, it works well on mobile, it quick to load, easy to use, is installable (if you want it) and doesn't spam.

I found that it was pretty hard to Google for the games, I can't find them all, so I've listed them here.

* [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) (The original)
* [Japanese Wordle](https://taximanli.github.io/kotobade-asobou/) (Kotobade Asobou - [Source code](https://github.com/taximanli/kotobade-asobou)) - I'm quite happy to have outscored my wife a couple of times with one.
* [Welsh Wordle](https://cyrdle.web.app/) (Cyrdle) - My wife and I have just started to learn Welsh, so we will be using this.
* [Norwegian Wordle](https://www.wordle.lol/) (https://twitter.com/WordleNorge)
* [Swedish](https://ordlig.se/)
* [French](https://wordle.louan.me/)
* \[Insert yours here] ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/Paul_Kinlan) at me or [email me](mailto:paulkinlan@google.com) if you have any suggestions)

It's even inspired some variations on the theme:

Thank you [Josh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wardle)! (and congratulations on the [sale](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60208463)).
