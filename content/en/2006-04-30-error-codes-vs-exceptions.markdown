Even many critical, backend server systems tend to break under heavy loads. And the vast majority of end-user applications handle errors gracefully only for the most well understood, commonly encountered conditions, but very poorly for most other conditions."</blockquote><p /><p /><a href="http://damienkatz.net/2006/04/error_code_vs_e.html">read more</a> | <a href="http://digg.com/software/Error_Codes_vs._Exceptions">digg story</a>
