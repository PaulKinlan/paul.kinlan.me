There has been another update to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/feroze_daud/archive/2005/10/24/484260.aspx">ICMP ping tutorial</a>.  Still nothing on the wire yet, but this is all the important information such as check summing.  Check it out it is a very good series so far. <p />Keep up the good work Feroze.<br /><blockquote>In this part, we will write a routine to calculate the checksum of the packet, and a routine to serialize the packet into a byte array. Recall from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/feroze_daud/archive/2005/10/23/483976.aspx">PartII</a> that the request and reply packets have a particular encoding on the wire. We will have to write a routine that will encode the packet into a byte array, so that the array can be sent on the wire.</blockquote><br /><i>[Via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/feroze_daud/archive/2005/10/24/484260.aspx">MSDN Blogs</a>]</i><p />
