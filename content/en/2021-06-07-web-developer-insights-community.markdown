Every year we work with Mozilla on the MDN Developer Needs Survey, and then every 3 months we run a survey with a random sample of web developers to understand how they view web development, what works for them and what doesn't.

These surveys give us a decent picture of how the broad challenges that developers face building for the web, and they help us prioritize where we should invest Engineering, Product and Developer Relations support. For example, from both of these Surveys it is clear that Web Compatibility, Testing and Documentation have been major areas of frustration for the developer Ecosystem.

It has been great to see how this impacted our teams direction over the last year or so. Firstly we prioritized [Web Compat](https://web.dev/compat2021/), and we've seen a number of improvements in Grid and Flexbox to name just a few changes that we hope improve the lives of developers; We also focused on how can we help improve documentation, and I'm proud of the team for working with Mozilla to ensure that a large number of API's that Chrome lands first have referenced documentation as well as our team being a founding member of the [Open Web Docs](https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs) collective to provide a neutral space to prioritize the References that developers need the most.

As noted, these surveys are good for a general steer of what's happening, but we find getting very direct feedback hard on specific projects, API proposals, or even Documentation. One example is that when a [Blink Intent](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/intent-to-explain-demystifying-blink.html) we document "Web Developer Signals", but where do these come from? Well, it depends and it's a lot of work for the Product Managers and Engineers to get this.

We get a lot of great feedback from Twitter and developers that we interact with 1:1 ([you can still book meetings with me if you want](https://paul.kinlan.me/helping-you-book-a-meeting/)), but our process is not very formal or consistent way to get insights so that we can help web developers. I've had feedback from many developers that web dev on Twitter don't represent the wider developer community and bias can be introduced there if we use that as our primary source of input.

To help us improve, we've worked with [C SPACE](https://cspace.com/) to build a dedicated community of about 1000 web developers from a range backgrounds, experiences, skill sets and industries who will provide us direct feedback to questions that we have about developer needs. The nice thing is that the community is a community, it's not just a place for us to ask questions - there's a lot of talk about many web development topics and challenges already, including Google's lack of ability to do support for some of our products.... To maintain open communication in the group and reduce the influence a Chrome team member might have as well as the perception you have to keep us happy to be part of the group, we're not allowed to participate in the conversation outside of scheduled times that we will work out with C SPACE.

If you are interested in joining, we should still have space for you [to sign-up](https://www.brandinvitation.com/wix/p3474224.aspx?said=QWERD5A&pcid=CLCS&aud=na&cid=na&enpt=lp&lang=9&l=9&udv=wdb), if by the time you read this we don't have here is the quick [intro video](https://youtu.be/h9Tp5XNWxYk) I made for the community explaining to all the members what we want to do.
