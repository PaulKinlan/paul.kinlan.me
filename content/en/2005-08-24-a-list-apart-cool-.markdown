I was just searching on Technorati, and one of the Top Searches was for <a href="http://www.alistapart.org">http://www.alistapart.org</a><p />They are using Ruby on Rails, I am not too sure what that is but it seems to be something based around the language Ruby. Why is Ruby good for developing Websites?<p />What is special about Ruby?<p />I have to admit it, their site looks pretty darn cool.  I like the colour scheme, it is quite neutral.  I like their <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/">articles</a> too!<p />I wonder if they used <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/colour-theory.html">Colour Theory</a>? :)<p />
