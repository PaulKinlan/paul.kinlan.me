<p>As a part of my "resolutions", I promised that I would get out of Google UK HQ and meet and work with developers more closely.</p>
<p>Myself and @mahemoff should be working from @Techhub (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=techhub&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=uk&amp;hq=techhub&amp;hnear=London&amp;cid=9476668700153430898">Here</a>) this Thursday (13th of Jan 2010).</p>
<div>So if you are about in the area I would love to meet you. &nbsp;I should be there from 09:00 to about 15:30.</div>
