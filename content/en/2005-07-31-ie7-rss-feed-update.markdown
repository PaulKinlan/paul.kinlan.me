Something I have just discovered is that you can subscribe any link to your default RSS Aggregator.  Obviously, if it is not an RSS feed it means nothing.<p />You right click on the link and then click the 'Subscribe in default RSS reader'.  Not sure if it is on by default or if it is an RSS Bandit thing.  I suspect it is an IE 7 feature.<p />
