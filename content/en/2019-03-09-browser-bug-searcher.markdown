I was just reflecting on some of the [work our team has done](https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev) and I found a project from 2017 that Robert Nyman and Eric Bidelman created. [Browser Bug Searcher!](https://browser-issue-tracker-search.appspot.com/?q=Web%20Share).

It's incredible that with just a few key presses you have a great overview of your favourite features across all the major browser engines.

This actually highlights one of the issues that I have with crbug and webkit bug trackers, they don't have a simple way to get feeds of data in formats like RSS. I would love to be able to use my [topicdeck](https://github.com/PaulKinlan/topicdeck) aggregator with bug categories etc so I have a dashboard of all the things that I am interested in based on the latest information from each of the bug trackers.
