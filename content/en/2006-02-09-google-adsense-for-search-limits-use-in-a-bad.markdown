title: Google Adsense For Search Limits Use [In a Bad Way]
published: true
---
With the introduction of IE7 Beta 2's custom search providers, I was hoping that I could implement an opensearch specification that will use all the parameters that hook up to my Google Adsense for search account. This way I could provide a site search directly within IE7 that hooks up with google's adsense for search and perhaps generate a little extra revenue.<p />Google does not allow it!<p /><br /><blockquote>AdSense for Search. If You have elected to receive Search Results, You will display on Your Site(s) a Google search box (a "Search Box") in accordance with the specifications provided by Google. Each Web page(s) that contains a Search<br />Box must also contain other content related to Your Site. Except for related Google queries, all search queries (including queries entered into an Ad search box) must originate from <strong>individual human end users inputting data directly into a Search Box</strong> (or Ad search box, as applicable) on Your Site(s). You will send any and all queries (without editing, modifying, or filtering such queries individually or in the aggregate) to Google and Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide You with corresponding Search Results and/or Ads, as applicable and as available. Search Results and any accompanying Ads will be displayed on Web pages hosted by Google (each, a "Search Results Page"), the format, look and feel of which may be modified by Google from time to time.</blockquote><br /><span style="">If only Google allowed you to do this it would be great.  Opensearch is an amazing idea, but google are stifling what I can do.</span><p />Ah well.<p />
