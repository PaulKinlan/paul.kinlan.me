I have noticed something wierd, since the start of this month I have recieved nearly all the hits on my site that I did last month; we are only 8 days into the month so something has happened.<p />I noticed Google is sending a lot my way. I am not too sure why I get preference over anyone else because MSN and Yahoo have only sent me about to combined.<p />Anyway here are my stats.<p />- Google 843<br />- Yahoo 11<br />- MSN 8<br />- Unknown search engines 7<br />- Google (Images) 3<br />- Dogpile 1<br />- AOL 1<br />- Netscape 1<p />Most of the searches are C# based so I need to still talk more c#. I feel that I am obliged to at least answer some of the queries that people ask of my site.<p />
