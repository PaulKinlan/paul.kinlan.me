<p>I have created a video to show you how easy it is to create great scrolling layers for your game in less than 3 minutes (including me making mistakes).  </p> <p>The basic components of the parallax engine are four fold: </p> <ol> <li>the engine itself  </li>
<li>the layers  </li>
<li>the camera  </li>
<li>the scrollers.</li>
</ol> <p>The enigne co-ordinates the layers by using the camera and the scrollers.</p> <p>The layers represent a repeating background.  The background posistion can be modified by the scrollers.  </p> <p>The camera represents a view on the world, where ever the camera is the engine will know how to convert the posistion of the layers correctly so that the scrolling still works.</p> <p>[[posterous-content:EdaIBFGhrICeEvasgnlJ]]The demo film shows first how to create a simple scrolling layer that scrolls left to right, then later on in the video it shows how a developer can add more effects to the backgrounds, such as simple scrollers combined with an oscillator.  </p> <p><a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/videos/Clouds.wmv" target="_blank">Watch WMV.</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtxXFUJ127I" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-6747011683599718110" target="_blank">Watch on Google Video</a></p> <p>All of this was done with no code required!</p> <p>I am always looking for suggestions on how to improve this project, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  You can leave feedback here, or on the forum [<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Project/ListForums.aspx?ProjectName=xnaparalax">Discussions</a>]</p> <p>tags: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/xna" rel="tag">xna</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/gamecomponents" rel="tag">gamecomponents</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/gamecomponent" rel="tag">gamecomponent</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/parallax" rel="tag">parallax</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/engine" rel="tag">engine</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/wmv" rel="tag">wmv</a></p>
