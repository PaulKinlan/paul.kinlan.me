summary: I'm diving into the official CSS 2.1 specification to build a C# based token
  reader for CSS parsing.  The document itself is quite dense, but it lays out the
  syntax and provides regular expressions to guide the implementation.  This is going
  to be a challenging but interesting project.

title: CSS C# Token Reader

---
I was just reading the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#tokenization">CSS 2.1</a> with the aim to create a CSS token reader in C#.  It is a pretty tough document to get through.  It defines the sytnax of a CSS file and provides regex's that could be used to read the CSS correctly.<p />It will however take me a little while to get anywhere with it though :)<p />
