title: CSS C# Token Reader

I was just reading the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#tokenization">CSS 2.1</a> with the aim to create a CSS token reader in C#.  It is a pretty tough document to get through.  It defines the sytnax of a CSS file and provides regex's that could be used to read the CSS correctly.<p />It will however take me a little while to get anywhere with it though :)<p />
