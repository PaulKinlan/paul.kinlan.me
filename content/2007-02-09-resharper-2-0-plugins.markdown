summary: In a previous post, I discussed the scarcity of ReSharper plugins and sample
  code.  I'm happy to announce that JetBrains has launched a new resource page dedicated
  to ReSharper Plugin Development. This page provides guides and sample code to help
  you create your own plugins. You'll need ReSharper 2.5 or later, which is a free
  upgrade for existing users.

title: Resharper 2.0 Plugins

<p>I little while ago I wrote about the lack of resharper plugins and sample code for the plugins [<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2006/11/resharper-20-plugins.html" title="Resharper Plugin Post" target="_blank">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2006/11/resharper-20-plugins.html</a>].  Jetbrains has now started up a new page [<a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+Plugin+Development" title="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+Plugin+Development">http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+Plugin+Development</a>] which contains guides and also sample code on how to create plugins.  You will need Resharper 2.5+, but that is a free upgrade if you already have resharper.</p> <p> </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Topicala Tags: <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/resharper" rel="tag">resharper</a>, <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/openApi" rel="tag">openApi</a>, <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/development" rel="tag">development</a>, <a href="http:/www.topicala.com/tag/.net" rel="tag">.net</a>
