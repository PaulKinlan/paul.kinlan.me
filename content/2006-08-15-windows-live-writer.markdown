<p>I am writing this through Windows Live Writer.  There is a lot of talk on blogs about this at the moment.</p> <p>I must say initially I am quite impressed.  Whilst editing this post it is using the colours and styles of my site.</p> <p>The applications appears to be extendable, using an SDK.  I am not sure as to what is involved in writing an extension but it should be fun. More information about extensions can be found at <a href="http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2006/08/14/44.aspx">http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2006/08/...</a></p> <p>The speed of the application is quick.</p> <p>The only other thing is that it appears to have the functionality that most other Blogging tools have so it is already well equipped. </p> <p>I have not noticed any bugs.  It even works correctly on this Blogger account that is stored on my server.  </p> <p>I am going to have a play with some of the pluggins to see what they can do.</p>
