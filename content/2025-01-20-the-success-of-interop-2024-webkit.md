I saw [The success of Interop 2024!](https://webkit.org/blog/16413/the-success-of-interop-2024) in Stefan Judis's [Web Weekly](https://webweekly.email/) Newsletter.

Jen Simmons at Apple on WebKit pulled together this great post about the progress that has been made in 2024.

> In 2024, there were 17 such focus areas: Accessibility, CSS Nesting, Custom Properties, Declarative Shadow DOM, font-size-adjust, HTTPS URLs for WebSocket, IndexedDB, Layout, Pointer and Mouse Events, popover, Relative Color Syntax, requestVideoFrameCallback, Scrollbar Styling, @starting-style & transition-behavior, Text Directionality, text-wrap: balance and URL.

The value of Interop is so important. It's the reason that the web has been so successful. It's the reason that we can build things that work across all devices and all browsers. It's the reason that we can build things that work for everyone and I'm grateful for the collaboration between all the browser vendors on this.

We just have to be careful to say "the web is XX% interoperable" when the data in the interop project is a percentage of the shared focus areas, not of the entire platform. [The dashboard](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024) is pretty clear, the actual situation of wider interoperability [has a long way to go](https://wpt.fyi/results/?label=experimental&label=master&aligned).

Either way, we should celebrate this progress. The web is getting better.
