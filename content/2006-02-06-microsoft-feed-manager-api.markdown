Is it me or is the<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/feedsapi/rss/overviews/msfeeds_ovw.asp"> Microsoft Feed Manager API  </a>not a Managed API?  I have just read through it and it all seems to be COM based.<p />What has happened to Microsoft "policy" of creating nearly everything for Vista via Managed Code?  Additionally, condsidering RSS is XML and .Net Handles XML like nobodies business I would have thought a managed API was a no-brainer.  All this means that I have to Interop just to use this new feature.... give me a break.<p />Am I being silly?<p />
