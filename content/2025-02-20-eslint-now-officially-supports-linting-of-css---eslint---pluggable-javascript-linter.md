> We feel that validation and enforcing baseline features are the minimum that a linter needs to support in 2025, and so we spent a lot of time making the no-invalid-at-rules, no-invalid-properties, and require-baseline rules as comprehensive as possible.

Love it!! Absolutely love it.

One of the areas that we would love to see more of (and we hope to work) is more integration of Baseline in to developer workflows. That could be Linters (like ESLint), boot-strappers, IDEs, compilers, frameworks, DevTools. You name it, I think it would help the entire ecosystem if we could get see increase awareness and usage of Baseline and therefore adoption of the features that all the browsers implement natively in to the hands of developers.

Exciting times.
