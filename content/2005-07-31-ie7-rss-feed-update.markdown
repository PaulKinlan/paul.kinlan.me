summary: IE7 introduces the ability to subscribe to any link in your default RSS aggregator.
  This function allows users to right-click a link and select the \"Subscribe in default
  RSS reader\" option. While useful for valid RSS feeds, this feature does not work
  for other content types. Whether this is specific to Internet Explorer 7, enabled
  by default, or a result of extensions like RSS Bandit is uncertain.

title: IE7 RSS Feed Update

---
Something I have just discovered is that you can subscribe any link to your default RSS Aggregator.  Obviously, if it is not an RSS feed it means nothing.<p />You right click on the link and then click the 'Subscribe in default RSS reader'.  Not sure if it is on by default or if it is an RSS Bandit thing.  I suspect it is an IE 7 feature.<p />
