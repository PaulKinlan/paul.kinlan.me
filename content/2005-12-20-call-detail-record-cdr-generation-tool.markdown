I have uploaded the Call Detail Record Generator that I created for my final year project a couple of years ago [<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/finalyearproject/CDR%20Tool.zip">CDR Tool.zip</a>].  It is a MS Access 2003 Application.<p />The application will generate thousands of "virtual" phone calls mimicing specific groups of people that would be a telecom company's customers.<p />You can change so many parameters that it is unbelivable.  You can model many types of users,  High usage users, low usage users, fraudulent users, National Rate users etc etc.   You can configure the average cost of a call, the average duration of a call; you can also supply times when a type of user is most likely to make a call so you can model business users and home users etc.<p />Each of these models are generated and then passed through to the Nerual network for trainging.<p />Have a play with it.  It is quite simple to use.<p />
