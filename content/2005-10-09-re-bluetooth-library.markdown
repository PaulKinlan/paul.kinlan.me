I have just seen this on blogs.msdn.com.<br /><blockquote>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;">Very nice <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/embedded/usewinemb/ce/sharedsrccode/west/default.aspx" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/embedded/usewinemb/ce/sharedsrccode/west/default.aspx">managed Bluetooth library </a>for Windows Mobile that looks to make it extremely easy write Bluetooth apps.</p>

</blockquote><br /><i>[Via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/trobbins/archive/2005/10/09/478732.aspx">MSDN Blogs</a>]</i><p />Its quite interesting, but also quite annoying.  I have never ever seen a managed blue tooth library for a standard PC.  I have blue tooth connected to my PC so I can connect my phones to it.  Why can't I programme little apps to interact with phones/pdas etc near my PC.  I want to be able to do that but I can't.  Does anybody know of a managed bluetooth stack that I can use in my .Net apps?<p />
