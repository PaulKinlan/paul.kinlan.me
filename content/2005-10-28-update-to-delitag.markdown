summary: I've just added a new feature to my website! Now, you can easily tag any
  page (except the main page) with relevant keywords and submit them directly to Del.icio.us.  Just
  select the text, click \"Generate Tags,\" choose the tags you want, enter your Del.icio.us
  credentials, and hit \"Submit Tags.\" It's all AJAX-powered for a smooth experience.
  Currently works in IE6 and above, with Firefox compatibility coming soon. Try it
  out on this post!
tags:
- del.icio.us
- tagging
- ajax
- website
- update
- feature
- internet explorer
- firefox
title: Update to DeliTag

Every single page that is not the main page on my site now has the ability to post tags to Del.icio.us.  It is very simple to use, you select the text that you think contains the important information about a post; click "Generate Tags"; select the tags that it returns and then click "Submit Tags".  This will then submit that page with the related tags to del.icio.us.  You also have to put your user name and password in.<p />Have a go.  Click on the title of this entry to go to the Item Page and then you can go from there.<p />It is all AJAX Based and unfortuantly needs IE6 and above at the moment.  I will make it Firefox compatible soon.<p />
