Every single page that is not the main page on my site now has the ability to post tags to Del.icio.us.  It is very simple to use, you select the text that you think contains the important information about a post; click "Generate Tags"; select the tags that it returns and then click "Submit Tags".  This will then submit that page with the related tags to del.icio.us.  You also have to put your user name and password in.<p />Have a go.  Click on the title of this entry to go to the Item Page and then you can go from there.<p />It is all AJAX Based and unfortuantly needs IE6 and above at the moment.  I will make it Firefox compatible soon.<p />
