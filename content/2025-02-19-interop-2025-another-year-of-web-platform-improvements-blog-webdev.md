It's exciting to see the web platform continue to evolve and improve. Interop along with Baseline are aimed to solve [some of the top challenges](https://paul.kinlan.me/challenges-for-web-developers/) that developers have when building for the web.

Ultimately we only make progress as a platform when the major user-agents make shared and consistent progress on the platform and this has been a huge effort from the teams at Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Apple, not to mention Igalia and Bocoup as well as all the developers that have helped to prioritize what is important to them.

Here are the announcements from other browsers:

* [WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/16458/announcing-interop-2025/)
* [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2025/02/interop-2025/)
* [Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/02/13/microsoft-edge-and-interop-2025/)
* [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/2025/02/13/Interop-2025.html)
* [Bocoup](https://bocoup.com/blog/interop-2025)

While I've been following the progress on Interop I hadn't noticed that they are looking at new areas of investment:

> In addition, and as in previous years, there's a set of areas for investigation. These are areas where we don't have enough information or tests to include as a focus area, but the group feels some work should be done to get them to a stage where we can include them.
>
> * Accessibility testing
> * Gamepad API testing
> * Mobile testing
> * Privacy testing
> * WebVTT

This feels like a good set of areas to focus on. I'm particularly interested in the Accessibility testing and Privacy testing. I think these are areas that are often overlooked and are critical to the success of the web platform.

Finally, I encourage everyone to look towards the tooling that is available because of the work that the Interop group is doing to understand all of the [web-features](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/web-features/) and their availability across the platform.

> You can follow along on the Interop 2025 dashboard at [https://wpt.fyi/interop-2025](httos://wpt.fyi/interop-2025) and as things become Baseline Newly available they'll show up in the Baseline 2025 list on [webstatus.dev](https://webstatus.dev) too.
