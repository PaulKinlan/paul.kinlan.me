summary: I found a cool tagging website, Tagyu, that suggests tags based on other
  people's discussions.  I'm working on my own version, which I believe will be even
  better when it's finished!

title: Someone is beating me to it

They have a tagger that works off what other people are talking about.<p /><a href="http://www.tagyu.com/" title="Tagyu">http://www.tagyu.com/</a><p />You insert your blog entry in there and then you get some tags.  It is pretty neat, but mine will be neater (when it is done)! :)<p />
