They have a tagger that works off what other people are talking about.<p /><a href="http://www.tagyu.com/" title="Tagyu">http://www.tagyu.com/</a><p />You insert your blog entry in there and then you get some tags.  It is pretty neat, but mine will be neater (when it is done)! :)<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
