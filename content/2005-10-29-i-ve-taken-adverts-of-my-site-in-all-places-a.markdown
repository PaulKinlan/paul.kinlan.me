summary: I've removed Google AdSense ads from my site's main page due to poor visibility
  and ineffectiveness.  I've relocated them to a spot just before the comment section
  within articles. Hoping this placement change will improve their performance!

title: I've taken Adverts of my site in all places apart from the Entry

I was getting really annoyed/bored with the Adsense adverts on the main page.  They weren't very visible and I am sure they did nothing for the site.  They only place they are in now is the article just before the comments.  Lets see if this makes any difference.<p />
