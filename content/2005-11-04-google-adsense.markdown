summary: I've just added a Google AdSense referral link to my blog!  Google recently
  updated AdSense, including their terms and conditions. While I spotted mentions
  of \"Feeds\" and \"Referrals\" in the new terms, I haven't yet seen Feed Advertising
  in action.  If you're interested in monetizing your blog, give AdSense a try!

Google has added a new feature (as well as updated their T's &amp; C's).  I noticed the terms mentioned Feeds and Referrals, however I have not seen anything about the Feed Advertising, but I have added a referal link on my blog.<p />If you feel like you could benefit from joining adsense then try joining.<p />
