Google has added a new feature (as well as updated their T's &amp; C's).  I noticed the terms mentioned Feeds and Referrals, however I have not seen anything about the Feed Advertising, but I have added a referal link on my blog.<p /><br />If you feel like you could benefit from joining adsense then try joining.<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
