The way that I write sucks!  That is all that I can say, I don't think I have a very good grasp on the English language (which is pretty poor since I live in England!!).  My Vocabulary is limited and my punctuation is abysmal.  I am prototyping this post in Microsoft Word so the spelling and vocabulary should be fine (synonym suggestion).  I believe this blog has however, has allowed me to improve the way that I write.  I need to do more though.  I was thinking of getting the book “Eats, Shoots and Leaves” because from what I have heard it is a great introduction to grammar.<p />I don’t want my blog to be a palace of grammatical correctness, I still want it to be personal, but I would like it to read well.  <p />So here goes.  Learn where to put commas correctly; learn about Semi-colons (Was the previous one correct?); learn how to structure sentences and learn how to structure sentences and paragraphs.<p />
