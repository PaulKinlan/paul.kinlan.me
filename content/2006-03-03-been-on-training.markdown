summary: I've just completed a Mastering UML training course at IBM Education Services
  in London.  It was a good course and I learned a lot, particularly because the instructor,
  Chas Weaver, incorporated his own experiences.  The only downside was the lack of
  Internet access.

title: Been on training

---
I have been on a Mastering UML training course at IBM Eductation services in London the past week and have not had access to the Internet.  <p />I hope to catch up on blogging.<p />The course was pretty good (accept for no Internet Access).  I learnt quite a bit.  Chas Weaver (The instuctor) was good too!  He applies alot of his experiences to the course.<p />
