I have been on a Mastering UML training course at IBM Eductation services in London the past week and have not had access to the Internet.  <p />I hope to catch up on blogging.<p />The course was pretty good (accept for no Internet Access).  I learnt quite a bit.  Chas Weaver (The instuctor) was good too!  He applies alot of his experiences to the course.<p />
