title: Related Wikipedia Articles in AjaxTagger v1 is broke

I have broken support for the time being in the related Wikipedia articles of the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">AJAX Tagger</a>.  It is broken because I have update one of my Yahoo: Perl Proxy Scripts for version 2 of the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">AJAX Tagger</a>.  I will try and update the page to get it working soon :)<p />
