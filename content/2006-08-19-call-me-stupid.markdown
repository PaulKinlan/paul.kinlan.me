summary: I'm struggling to create a C# plugin for Windows Live Writer.  Even a simple
  \"Hello World\" plugin isn't showing up in the available plugins list, despite the
  documentation and example seeming straightforward.  The example code compiles and
  works fine, but my copied version doesn't. I'm completely stumped and wondering
  if there are any logs I can check for Windows Live Writer.

<p>I have been sitting at my desk for 45 minutes now trying to work out how to create a plugin for the Windows Live write in C#.</p> <p>Reading the documentation, it should be one of the easiest things in the world.</p> <p>Reading the Example, it should be one of the easiest things in the world.</p> <p>Writing a simple "Hello World" app has become so frustrating.  All my code seems to be okay.  But it won't appear in the list of the available plugins.</p> <p>If I compile the example, the example appears fine and dandy.  If a copy word for word the example I can't get it to appear in the Windows Live Write App.</p> <p>I have no idea what I am doing wrong.</p> <p>Does anyone know if there are any logs produced by Windows Live Writer?</p>
