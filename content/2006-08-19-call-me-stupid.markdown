<p>I have been sitting at my desk for 45 minutes now trying to work out how to create a plugin for the Windows Live write in C#.</p> <p>Reading the documentation, it should be one of the easiest things in the world.</p> <p>Reading the Example, it should be one of the easiest things in the world.</p> <p>Writing a simple "Hello World" app has become so frustrating.  All my code seems to be okay.  But it won't appear in the list of the available plugins.</p> <p>If I compile the example, the example appears fine and dandy.  If a copy word for word the example I can't get it to appear in the Windows Live Write App.</p> <p>I have no idea what I am doing wrong.</p> <p>Does anyone know if there are any logs produced by Windows Live Writer?</p>
