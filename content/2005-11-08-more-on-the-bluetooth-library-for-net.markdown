summary: I've been experimenting with the Bluetooth library for .NET I mentioned earlier,
  but I'm having trouble getting it to work.  I wanted to connect my phone to my computer
  and transfer images, but it's not working as expected. The library itself seems
  fine, it's likely my understanding of Bluetooth communication that's lacking.  On
  the plus side, detecting devices with the library is very easy!

title: More on the Bluetooth Library for .Net

---
I have been trying to play around with the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/10/following-my-post-about-lack-of.html">Managed C# Library for Bluetooth</a> that I mentioned on my site a while back.<p />Can't say I can really make head nor tail of it. To be honest though, it is not the library that is at fault. It is me, I just thought I could have my phone connect to my machine and read the Images that I send from it off the phone. It didn't work :( Gutted. I know I am doing something wrong so I will have to read about Bluetooth communication a bit more :)<p />Detecting devices is simple though! :)  Really simple!<p />
