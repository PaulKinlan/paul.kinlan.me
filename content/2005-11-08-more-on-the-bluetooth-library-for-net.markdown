I have been trying to play around with the <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/10/following-my-post-about-lack-of.html">Managed C# Library for Bluetooth</a> that I mentioned on my site a while back.<p />Can't say I can really make head nor tail of it. To be honest though, it is not the library that is at fault. It is me, I just thought I could have my phone connect to my machine and read the Images that I send from it off the phone. It didn't work :( Gutted. I know I am doing something wrong so I will have to read about Bluetooth communication a bit more :)<p />Detecting devices is simple though! :)  Really simple!<p /><br /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
