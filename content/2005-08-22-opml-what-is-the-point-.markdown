summary: I'm exploring OPML and trying to understand its purpose and potential uses.  I've
  come across mentions of it by Robert Scoble, who suggests it could connect various
  forms of media like podcasts and photo-sharing. However, I'm struggling to grasp
  how this would work in practice. I'm also looking into resources from Dave Winer
  and others to learn more.  I'd appreciate any helpful links or information on OPML.
