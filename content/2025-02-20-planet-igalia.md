Link: [Planet Igalia](https://planet.igalia.com/)

When I was preparing the [Interop post](https://paul.kinlan.me/2025-02-19-interop-2025-another-year-of-web-platform-improvements-blog-webdev/) yesterday, I found one of the agalia links didn't work and while I was hunting for the new link, I found [Planet Igalia](https://planet.igalia.com/). :mind-blown:

I've always wondered what's happening at Igalia and [while I love the podcast](https://www.igalia.com/chats/), I do love a good Blog.... I'm really not sure how I missed this entire part of the site, but it's go so much good information and often frequent deep dives in to browsers.  For example Maxsim Sisov's post on "[Unmasking Hidden Floating-Point Errors in Chromiumâ€™s Ozone/Wayland](https://blogs.igalia.com/msisov/unmasking-hidden-floating-points-errors-in-ozone-wayland/)" - such an awesome read into an area I had zero knowledge about.

Triff and marv.
