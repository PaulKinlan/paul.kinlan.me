One of the searches that came in was:<strong>oops c#</strong>.I would love to know how to reply to that one, or what the Google user meant by that.  <p />What did oops mean?<ul>
<li>Object Orientated Prototyping System?</li>
<li>Object-Oriented Programming System</li>
<li>General C# gotcha's?</li>
</ul><p />I know this is a long shot, but if you were the person who  asked about this could you email me: <a href="mailto:%20paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a>, so that I know what it was about.<p />
