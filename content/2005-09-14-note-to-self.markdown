summary: I'm really interested in ATLAS (AJAX), but I need to prioritize my time.  I
  can't afford to get sidetracked by this project right now, especially since it's
  not .Net-based and my current work focuses on .Net.

Don't get stuck in to <a href="http://beta.asp.net/default.aspx?tabindex=7&amp;tabid=47" title="ATLAS AJAX Stuff">ATLAS </a>just yet.<p />Everyone, make sure I don't do this. I don't have the time for this project and also it is not done .Net [although that is my day job].<p />
