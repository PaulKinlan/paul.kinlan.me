summary: Keeping a 'did.txt' file is a simple yet effective way to track daily progress
  and solidify learning, especially useful when learning to code.  It's similar to
  the 'snippets' we use internally, offering a concise record of individual and team
  accomplishments. I recommend structuring weekly summaries with 'what I did' and
  'what I intend to do this week' sections for reflection and planning.

This is not a million miles away from what we do internally, where we have a concept of 'snippets'. It's up to you how you manage it, but it's a great way of keeping track of what you did, but also shared across your team you get a nice picture of what your peers, managers and reports are also doing.

The model I like is to split each weekly summary into a 'what I did' and 'what intend to do this week'. It helps me reflect and plan at the same time.
