summary: I've downloaded the Google Desktop Search 2.0 Beta and I'm liking it so far.
  My only complaint is not being able to force indexing when not idle. It seems to
  be lightweight, which is great for my computer. I've installed the Adsense plugin
  and the Gmail plugin is a plus. The feed detection is excellent, even better than
  IE7 Beta 1. I'll post more thoughts after I've used it longer.

I have just downloaded the Google Desktop Search 2.0 Beta, I quite like it.  I would like to be able to force it to index when not Idle, but thats the only complaint so far.<p />I am looking forward to being able to search for things amazingly quickly, I have held off from using others because they took up lots of resources on my pitifully weak machine.  This one seems to be pretty good though.<p />I have installed an Adsense plugin to see how much revenue I don't get from this blog. ;)<p />I like the Gmail plugin that comes as standard, and the feed detection is really really good.  It beats Internet Explorer (IE7 Beta 1) hands down.  It shows a very simple outline of all the blog entries that I am interested in.  It doesn't allow any aggregation of any sort, so it is more of a news bulletin system.  Its pretty cool though.<p />I will post more opinions once I have played with it a bit more.<p />
