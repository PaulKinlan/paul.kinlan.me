Finally after making the decision to remove Google Desktop Beta 2 from my machine, I decided that I would try and explore just a little more. Low and Behold! I find a feature that I think that I might not now be able to live with out.<p />Desktop Timeline!<br />[[posterous-content:nHbcIeuoCHFfJtrdlxij]]<p />It shows you everything you have been working on for a given day, to a stupidly amazing amount of detail.  It shows, when I looked at a page, when I opened a document etc.  <p />[[posterous-content:GHIEvtpGbsBHbojHExvJ]]<p />It is a really good feature if you were to say "I was reading a page at about 12pm on Tuesday, now what was the address" or, "I was looking at a document in the evening, now what was the name of it".  And it all accessed via a little date picker.<p />[[posterous-content:jAEkxeIpslbfrHjztmpd]]<p />I must say.  It is darned SWEET!!!!<p />I am going to toss a coin now to see if I keep it or not: Heads, Google Wins; Tails, Google Loses.<p />Flick....<br />Catch.....<br />.....<br />Tails.<p />Sorry Google, I am removing it. I don't think I will try it again. I feel like I am giving away too much of myself to you! And my PC was really, really, really slow.<p />Sorry!<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
