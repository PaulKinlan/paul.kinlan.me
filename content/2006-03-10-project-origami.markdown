summary: I'm not as impressed by Project Origami as others seem to be. While the idea
  of an ultra-mobile PC is appealing, and I'd like to own one, it feels like a somewhat
  predictable development in technology.

For all the hype, Project Origami really isn't that interesting to me.  Its a nice idea dont get me wrong and I would love to have one myself, but it seems to be kind of an obvious thing to make.<p />
