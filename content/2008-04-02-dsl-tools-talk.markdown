<p>On the 17th of April I will be doing a talk at the Liverpool Users of .Net User group about Domain Specific Language Tools and T4 templates.</p> <p>The general flow of the talk will be:</p> <ol> <li>A brief overview of Domain Specific Languages.</li> <li>What are the Microsoft DSL Tools and examples of toolkits in use</li> <ol> <li>What the Microsoft DSL Tools are not</li>
</ol> <li>Where they can be used and how they can help developers and end-users.</li> <li>And a step-by-step guide of the creation of a DSL Tool (hopefully this can be workshop based).</li>
</ol> <p>If you would like to attend it is being held at AIMES (<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/venue/123846/" title="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/venue/123846/">http://upcoming.yahoo.com/venue/123846/</a>) the event information can be found on upcomming: <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/454169/" title="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/454169/">http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/454169/</a></p> <p>I will make the slides available if anyone wants to look at them.Â  All I have to do is work out what to say!</p> <p>If you know of any good tools implemented using the DSL Toolkit, let me know and I will include them in the talk.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Topicala Tags: <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/DSL" rel="tag">DSL</a>, <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/T4" rel="tag">T4</a>, <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/DSD" rel="tag">DSD</a>, <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/DSL%20Tools" rel="tag">DSL Tools</a>, <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/DSLTools" rel="tag">DSLTools</a>, <a href="http://www.topicala.com/tag/luodn" rel="tag">luodn</a>
