  .Net User group on April 17th.  The talk will cover an overview of DSLs, what Microsoft
  DSL Tools are (and aren't), how they can be used, and a walkthrough of creating
  a DSL Tool.  The event is at AIMES and details can be found on Upcoming.yahoo.com.  I'll
  share the slides afterward.  Let me know if you have any good examples of tools
  built with the DSL Toolkit!
