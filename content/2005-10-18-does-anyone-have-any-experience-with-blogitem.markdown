summary: I'm struggling to get the BlogItemBacklinkCount tag to display backlink counts
  for my Blogger blog hosted on my own server.  I suspect it might not function in
  this setup, leading me to believe the entire backlink system isn't automatic as
  advertised.  Has anyone else encountered similar issues?

I am having trouble with Blogger's BlogItemBacklinkCount tag for BackLinks.  Does it work when you are hosting the blog on your own servers?  I have a feeling it doesn't, which led me to belive that <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/10/why-i-dont-like-blogger-backlinks.html" title="I don't like Backlinks">none of it was automatic</a>.<p />
