summary: I bought a used Xbox 360 controller to test game development using XNA for
  PC and the upcoming Xbox 360. The XNA programming model works well, and I can access
  controller inputs like trigger pressure.  I couldn't install the official Xbox 360
  controller driver for Windows XP, but the XBCD drivers worked seamlessly.  Find
  them at xbcd360guide.50webs.com (use at your own risk, the site looks a bit sketchy).

<p>Because I am a nerd and I want to develop some games using the XNA for the PC and the 360 when it comes out, I went down to the local GameStation and bought a cheap second hand Xbox 360 controller.</p> <p>I have just been testing the programming model with it and all seems well.  I can sesne the pressure on the triggers and all that stuff using the XNA.</p> <p>One thing that I did notice is that I couldn't install the Xbox 360 Controller Common driver for the Windows XP.  However I did find that XBCD drivers worked for me and it works with the XNA.  You can find the drivers here [<a href="http://xbcd360guide.50webs.com/">http://xbcd360guide.50webs.com/</a>]</p> <p>I presume the download is okay, nothing scary has happened, although the design of the site doesn't inspire any confidence. </p> <p>tags: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/xna" rel="tag">xna</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/xbox360" rel="tag">xbox360</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/360" rel="tag">360</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/controller" rel="tag">controller</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/directx" rel="tag">directx</a></p>
