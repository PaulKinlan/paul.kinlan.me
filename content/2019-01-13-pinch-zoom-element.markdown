Jake and the team built this rather awesome custom element for managing pinch zooming on any set of HTML outside of the browser's own pinch-zoom dynamics (think mobile viewport zooming). The element was one of the central components that we needed for the [squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) app that we built and released at Chrome Dev Summit (... I say 'released at Chrome Dev Summit' - Jake was showing it to everyone at the China Google Developer Day even though the rest of the team were under embargo ;) ... )

I just added it to my blog (took just a couple of minutes), you can check it out on my '[life](https://paul.kinlan.me/life/img_20170711_063830/)' section where I share photos that I have taken. If you are on a touch-enabled device you can quickly pinch-zoom on the element, if you are using a track-pad that can handle multiple finger inputs that works too.

This element is a great example of why I love web components as a model for creating user-interface components. The `pinch-zoom` element is just under 3kb on the wire (uncompressed) and minimal dependencies for building and it just does one job exceptionally well, without tying any custom application-level logic that would make it hard to use (I have some thoughts on UI logic vs App logic components that I will share based on my learning's from the Squoosh app).

I would love to see elements like these get more awareness and usage, for example I could imagine that this element could replace or standardise the image zoom functionality that you see on many commerce sites and forever take away that pain from developers.
