summary: This is the seventh post in my series about the failures of my first AJAX
  application. My biggest failure? No one used it! I had these grand visions of tons
  of users, but it turned out I was the only one. So, I'm changing my strategy.  I've
  started this blog to centralize all information about the AJAXTagger.  My next step
  is promotion!  I need users to try it, break it, and give me feedback.  Email me
  or leave a comment with your suggestions!

title: 'The Failures of my First AJAX application: Part 7'

---
This is the 7th instalment of the failures of my first AJAX application and more commonly know was "It generated no feedback from anyone at all!"<p />As in my previous post, when I was creating the application I had grand ideas about the people who might use this application. I had visions of thousands and thousands of people using it and having to ring up Yahoo to ask to have my 5000 daily query limit increased.<p />In actual fact, I was really the only person who used the application. Even though I was posting about it in my journal I didnâ€™t receive any feedback at all from the public.<p />This got me thinking. Even though the application is primarily for my benefit I would dearly love other people to use it. I would also need to get people talking about it. I would also need all the information to be available in one place (regarding the AJAXTagger).<p />My first step to more exposure is this Blog. All my content will still be aggregated on [http://www.kinlan.co.uk](http://www.kinlan.co.uk), but this blog is designed to deliver all the information about the development and use of the application in one simple place.<p />My next step after this will be to promote it. I need people to start talking about it; I need people to investigate the functionality it offers; I need you to use it, break it and criticise it!<p />Do you have any ideas how I might do this? Email me or leave a comment. I need the feedback to make this application better for me and for you. Every comment and suggestion will be taken on board.<p />[Paul.kinlan@gmail.com](mailto:Paul.kinlan@gmail.com)<p />
