Following on from my previous post about concerns over the way IE7 displays favorites (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/08/internet-explorer-7-favorites-problem.html">here</a>).<p />My IE7 (Internet Explorer 7 Beta 1) is crashing (as in every instance of it closes) when I try to view my favorites, it is okay when I view the favorites in collapsed form (see picture)<p />[[posterous-content:DvECEHuwAGJiJpeJsECc]]<p />When I click on the double down pointing cheveron, it completly crashes the application.  If you look at my previous post about the favorites you will see that I have a lot of unsorted favorites.<p />Has anyone else experienced this before.  Is there a work around?<br />Email if you can <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a><p />I will start adding searches back in soon to the sections below, because I know a fair few people found them useful.<p />
