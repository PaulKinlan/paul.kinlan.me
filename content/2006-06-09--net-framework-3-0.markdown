I have just seen the following over at Somasegar's blog (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/06/09/624300.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/06/09/624300.aspx</a>)<p /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">With this in mind we have decided to rename WinFX to the .NET Framework 3.0. .NET Framework 3.0 aptly identifies the technology for exactly what it is â€“ the next version of our developer framework.<p />The change is in name only and will not affect the technologies being delivered as part of the product. The .NET Framework 3.0 is still comprised of the existing .NET Framework 2.0 components, including ASP.NET, WinForms, ADO.NET, additional base class libraries and the CLR, as well as new developer-focused innovative technologies in WPF, WCF, WF and WCS:</blockquote><p />I don't see any mention of c# 3.0 in this package.   I think this name change is pointless and confusing!  Really, the reasons they give are not that convincing!<p />
