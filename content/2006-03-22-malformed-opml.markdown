summary: My OPML files are malformed, specifically the apostrophes in attributes aren't
  escaped.  If you use my Ajax Tagger v2, I apologize for this error, but it seems
  like it hasn't impacted many users so far.

My OPML files are malformed.  I need to get them sorted.<p />Apostrophes are not being escaped in the attributes.<p />If you have been using my Ajax Tagger v2, I am sorry about this, (but seeing as no one has reported this as a problem, I don't think anyone is using it that much :)<p />
