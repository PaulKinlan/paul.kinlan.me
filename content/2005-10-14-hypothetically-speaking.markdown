summary: This blog post asks readers for their opinion on including event announcements
  related to blog post topics.  For example, if a post is about Apple Macs, I wonder
  if readers would like to know about Mac Expos. Similarly, for a post about World
  War 2, it asks if announcing related events like commemoration days would be useful.
  Readers are invited to share their thoughts in the comments or via email.
