title: Just about to get the Internet Connection Installed

---
It has been a while since I last updated my site,  mainly due to the fact that we have just moved into a new house and we haven't got an Internet Connection yet. <p />Well that is about to change, I am getting the Telewest Broadband 4Mbs service today.  Well it is installed I just need to connect my PC up.<p />Cool! :)<p />
