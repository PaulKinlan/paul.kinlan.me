<p>I have started a Paralax (I think I got the spelling wrong :) Scrolling Component over on CodePlex [<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">http://www.codeplex.com/</a>].Â  It is an open source type of project that is designed to help game writers create repeating scrolling backgrounds.</p> <p>It is far from complete but has some basic functionality, such as a 2d Camera, Layer Oscilators and also Scrolling and Clipping.</p> <p>If you are interested in either the code or helping me code it visi the XNAParalax Component <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=XnaParalax">http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName...</a></p> <p>Or leave a comment, I would really love feedback.</p> <p>tags: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/xna" rel="tag">xna</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/xbox360" rel="tag">xbox360</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/c#" rel="tag">c#</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/.net" rel="tag">.net</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/tag/GameComponent" rel="tag">GameComponent</a></p>
