summary: I finally got a Windows Live Writer plugin working after starting from scratch!  Stay
  tuned as I'm planning to integrate my Ajax Tagger into the Windows Live Writer framework
  soon. This will be a cool experiment combining Web 2.0 APIs with Windows Live Writer.

<p>With Reference to my previous post "<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2006/08/call-me-stupid.html">Call Me Stupid</a>" I have now got a plugin working.</p> <p>The only thing that I can say that I did was to start from the beging again.</p> <p>Over the next couple of days when I get chance, I am going to convert my Ajax Tagger to the Windows Live Writer Framework.Â  It should be a good experiment of create a Mashup of Web 2.0 API's into the Windows Live Writer Application.</p> <p>Keep following me for updates.</p>
