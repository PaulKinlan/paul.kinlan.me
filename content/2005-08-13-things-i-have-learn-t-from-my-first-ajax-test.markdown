title: Things I have learn't from my first Ajax Test
published: true
---
<p>My first Ajax Application was a success and a failure at the same time. I have detialed some of the points below, and hopefully I will be able to discuss them in later posts, this will give me more content in more readable bitesized chunks. </p><p>Successes<br /></p><ol>
<li>It got me thinking Asynchronosly.</li>
<li>It got me thinking about how to code JavaScript for Firefox and Internet Explorer (IE6 and IE7)</li>
<li>It got me thinking about how the Yahoo! API works</li>
<li>It got me thinking about how to take advantage of the Technorati API</li>
<li>It got me thinking about all the other API"s that I want to see.</li>
<li>It got me thinking about how I communicate over my blog</li>
<li>It helped me publish related topics on Technorati</li>
<li>It got me thinking about Perl again!.</li>
<li>It got me thining about how I use Blogger.com</li>
</ol>Failures<br /><ol>
<li>It didn"t help me provide search facilities to related topics</li>
<li>It didn"t help reduce bandwidth</li>
<li>It looked absolutly terrible!!</li>
<li>It didn"t work to quickly (but it did lead to success number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ..... :))</li>
<li>It wasn"t visible to people other than myself what it actually achieved.</li>
<li>It didn"t help anyone other than myself</li>
<li>It genereated no feedback from anyone at all!</li>
<li>It didn"t generate much in the way of extra traffic.</li>
<li>It accomodated the lowest common denominator in web browsers, therefore it was not as client (as in browser) as I wanted.</li>
</ol><p>With each of these points, I will guide any of the readers through my designs and desires for the next application. Hopefully, it can be used by other people as a guide of what to do and not to do.</p><p>I"ll discuss some basic requirements; show how my first idea was not really a good one and show how my next idea will be better.</p><p>I think one of the first things to do after this is to publish a "What I want" requirements document. If I have that I can think about how each of the requirements will effect the design of the Application. </p><p>If anyone has any points that they would like to yell at me.
