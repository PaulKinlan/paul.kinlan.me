We've just had Sky+ installed here at home.  I must say it is pretty cool.  Set it up to record my programs :)  Star Gate SG1, Simpsons :)<p />It is the toshiba 80GB box and it has 2 USB ports on it, however I hear that you can't do anything with it :( ah well.<p />If anyone has any cool info about Sky+ let me know :)<br /><a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a><p />
