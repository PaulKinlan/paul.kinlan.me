summary: I'm exploring the idea of a \"Questions and Answers\" microformat to add
  semantic meaning to questions and their corresponding answers within text.  I propose
  using `<span class=qa><span class=question>Where does paul kinlan live?</span><span
  class=answer>liverpool</span></span>` as a potential structure. This could be beneficial
  for search functionality, allowing search engines to index question-answer pairs
  instead of entire pages.  I'm looking for feedback on whether this is a valuable
  concept, worth pursuing, or if it has already been discussed elsewhere.

Has a microformat been proposed around "Questions and Answers".<p /> I think it would be good to mark a question and the corresponding answer in<p /> &lt;span class=qa&gt;&lt;span class=question&gt;Where does paul kinlan live?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=answer&gt;liverpool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<p /> It could help solve some semantic meaning to what part of text is a question and what is the anwser.<p /> For instance I get a lot of searches coming to my site with queries such as "How do I...", "What does...".  I could set up a "search engine" that parses pages with this micro format in and indexes question and answer pairs rather than whole text pages. <p /> Is this a good idea?  Is it worth progressing?  Has it already been discussed?<p />
