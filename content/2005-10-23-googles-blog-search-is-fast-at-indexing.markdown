I didn't realise it until I subscribed to the results of a search in Google;  Google indexes RSS feeds quickly, it was about 10 minutes or so between when I uplloaded the article to when I saw it in the results.<p />Are the other people out there this fast.  Technorati seem to be pretty quick now, but I have to prompt them with a ping.  Googles, I didn't have to do anything unless Blogger do it for you.<p />
