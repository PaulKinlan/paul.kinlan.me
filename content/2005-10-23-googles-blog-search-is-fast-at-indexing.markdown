summary: Wow! Google Blog Search indexed my latest post in just minutes! I was amazed
  by how fast it appeared in the search results after uploading.  I'm curious if other
  search engines are this quick. Technorati is fast, but I have to ping them. With
  Google, it just worked automatically.  Big kudos to Google and possibly Blogger
  for the seamless integration!

title: Googles Blog Search is FAST at indexing

---
I didn't realise it until I subscribed to the results of a search in Google;  Google indexes RSS feeds quickly, it was about 10 minutes or so between when I uplloaded the article to when I saw it in the results.<p />Are the other people out there this fast.  Technorati seem to be pretty quick now, but I have to prompt them with a ping.  Googles, I didn't have to do anything unless Blogger do it for you.<p />
