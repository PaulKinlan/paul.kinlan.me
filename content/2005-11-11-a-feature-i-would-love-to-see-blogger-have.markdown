summary: I'd really like a feature in Blogger that lets me customize what's shown
  on the main blog page versus the individual post page.  Something like custom tags,
  maybe `<itempage></itempage>`, that would let me control the content displayed in
  each view.

title: A Feature I Would Love to See Blogger Have

I would love to be able to specify &lt;itempage&gt;&lt;/itempage&gt; directly inside a blog entry so that I can have different things appear on the main page and on the item page.<p />
