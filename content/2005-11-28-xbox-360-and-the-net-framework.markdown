summary: In a previous post, I discussed using the .NET Framework on the Xbox 360.  It
  turns out you can create Media Center applications, install them on your media server,
  and then control them via the Xbox 360 UI.  The processing happens on the Media
  Center PC.  More details are available in an MSDN article.

title: XBox 360 and the .Net Framework

Further to my <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/11/google-search-net-framework-for-xbox.html">post</a> a little while back about using the .Net Framework in the XBox 360, it seems that because the XBox 360 is a media centre consumer, you can create Media Center applications, install them on the media server and then run the UI elements through the XBox 360 with all the logic run against the Media Center<p />Not too sure how this works, but their is an article about it over on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/MedctrSDK/htm/creatinganaddin.asp">MSDN</a>.<p />
