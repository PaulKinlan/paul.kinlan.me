title: Ajax Tagger Version 1 Update to Wikipedia Documents
published: true

Ajax Tagger Version 1 has been fixed again in the wikipedia document section.  It now removes the " - Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia" from the results section.  This means that the page is now a lot clearer and it is easier to find related wikipedia documents.  It makes sense really and it totally fits around the linking policy of Wikipedia which states that at least one reference to Wikipedia be made.<p />
