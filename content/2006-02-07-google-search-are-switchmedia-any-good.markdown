One of the Google searches that came to my site was "are <a href="www.switchmedia.co.uk">switchmedia</a> any good?"<p />I have been a customer for a while now and I have had no problems at all.  They are very web hosting company.  I have seen some of the sites they have done, and they look great too.<p />This site is a template off Blogger that I use.<p />
