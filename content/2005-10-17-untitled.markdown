I don't know why, but I don't always agree with what Jacob Neilson says about useability issues.  But his latest article about <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/weblogs.html" title="Blog Useability">blog useablity</a> is spot on the mark.  I expect to implement several of his points.  Especially a personal photo.  I need to get my ugly mug about the Internet :)<p />
