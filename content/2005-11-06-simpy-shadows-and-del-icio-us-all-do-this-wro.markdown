summary: I'm curious why social bookmarking services like Simpy, Shadows, and del.icio.us
  prioritize a user's tags over a global view. When clicking a tag, I'd rather see
  globally relevant tagged pages than just those from a single user.  A single user's
  tagging habits aren't as useful as seeing the broader community's perspective on
  a topic.  Ideally, these services would offer a toggle between user-specific and
  global tag views.
tags:
- simpy
- shadows
- delicious
- social bookmarking
- tagging
- user experience
- global perspective
- ajax
title: SIMPY, SHADOWS and DEL.ICIO.US all do this wrong I think

I would love to know why services like Simpy and Shadows (to some extent) and del.icio.us all focus on a users tags and not the global perspective.  It seems that when I click on a tag on the front page of each of these services that is related to a web page, it lists all the other tagged pages of the same type that the user has posted and not the global point of view.  I would have thought that the global frame of reference was more important that a users individual one.  For instance I might have one 1 AJAX tag in my profile, what is the point in seeing that, I would be more initerested in what everyone else reckons is AJAX.<p />The option between a quick search of the users tags and the globally related tags would be nice.<p />What do you think?<p />
