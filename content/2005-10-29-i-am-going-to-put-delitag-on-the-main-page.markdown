summary: I'm excited to announce that DeliTag will be featured on the main page to
  increase visibility and usage.  It will also be available on Tagger.Kinlan.co.uk.  As
  a reminder, DeliTag is an AJAX-based mashup of Yahoo and Del.icio.us, allowing users
  to generate and post tags to Del.icio.us based on page content.

I really want people to see DeliTag and  use it.  Therefore I have also decided to put it on my main page.  I will also be putting it on <a href="http://tagger.kinlan.co.uk" title="Tagger">Tagger.Kinlan.co.uk</a>.<p />For those how don't know what DeliTag is.  It is an AJAX Based Mashup of a [Yahoo](developer.yahoo.net) and [Del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) web service.  It reads in the context of a page and creates tags that you can post to [Del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/)<p />
