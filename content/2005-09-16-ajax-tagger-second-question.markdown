I am just working on some requriements for the next version of the [AJAX Tagger](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag) application. If any of you could get back to me then I would greatly appreciate your feedback. <p />The reason why I created the [AJAX Tagger](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag) is that it allowed me to add value to my blog entries by linking readers of my blog with other blogs of a very similar topic.  Would you like to be able to have it use different sources rather than [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com).  For instance would you like it to link to [IceRocket](http://www.icerocket.com) etc?  Or is linking to related blog lists not what you want, would you like it to link to a site such as Wikipedia?<p />What I am trying to get at is:  Where would you like the application to create automatically tagged links too?<p />
