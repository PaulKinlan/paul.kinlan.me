summary: I'm developing the next version of the AJAX Tagger and need your input!  Currently,
  it enhances blog posts by linking to related blogs on Technorati.  For the next
  version, I'm wondering if you'd prefer it to link to other sources like IceRocket
  or even Wikipedia.  Let me know where you'd find automatic tag links most valuable.

title: AJAX Tagger Second Question

---
I am just working on some requriements for the next version of the [AJAX Tagger](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag) application. If any of you could get back to me then I would greatly appreciate your feedback. <p />The reason why I created the [AJAX Tagger](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag) is that it allowed me to add value to my blog entries by linking readers of my blog with other blogs of a very similar topic.  Would you like to be able to have it use different sources rather than [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com).  For instance would you like it to link to [IceRocket](http://www.icerocket.com) etc?  Or is linking to related blog lists not what you want, would you like it to link to a site such as Wikipedia?<p />What I am trying to get at is:  Where would you like the application to create automatically tagged links too?<p />
