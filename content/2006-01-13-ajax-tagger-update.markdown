I have just updated the <a href="http://ajaxtag.kinlan.co.uk">Ajax Tagger Version 2.0</a>.<p />Basically all that I have done is fixed a bug in it :)  It has been this way since christmas so no one will have used the tagger.  Sorry about that, but it is now up and running.<p />I have also added a Google Advert to see if that helps me out a little.<p />
