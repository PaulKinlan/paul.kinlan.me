<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rich_crane/archive/2006/02/12/530446.aspx">Rich Crane</a> reports that he has posted the Code to Internet Explorer Browser Modules along with some examples.<p />It looks like a pretty cool framework for getting .Net to interact with Internet explorer. I can't wait to have a play, and not have to worry about me handling all the COM interop etc [it is already done in this framework]. I did notice that the number of Browser Events that are available seems to be less than what IE exposes. Maybe I am wrong though.<p />Staying on the subject, <a href="http://www.ssware.com">Sky Software</a> who produce <a href="http://www.ssware.com/ezshell/ezshell.htm">EZShellExtensions.Net</a> and the <a href="http://www.ssware.com/megapack.htm">Shell MegaPack.Net</a> have produced new versions of their software for developers. The EZShellExtensions.Net software allows you to create Internet Explorer toolbands and Internet Explorer vertical and horizontal bands and <a href="http://www.ssware.com/ezshell/shots.htm">most things</a> you would want to do via Shell Extensions in .Net. The ShellMega pack is a collection of their own Shell Extensions that they have created ready for you to use.<p />Both packages support VS.Net 2002 - 2005 so that means it supports the .Net framework v1.0 - v2.0, whilst Rich Cranes project only supports VS 2005 from what I can tell. The prices of the product is quite reasonable for the stuff you get.<p />
