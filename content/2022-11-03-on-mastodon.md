summary: "The author has rejoined Mastodon, after previously trying it years ago.  Motivated by potential Twitter costs and a desire for more control, they've opted to self-host their Mastodon instance for a similar price. While still maintaining a Twitter presence for learning and connections, the author expresses enthusiasm for the open, interoperable nature of Mastodon and its PWA."

I'm over on [Mastodon](https://status.kinlan.me/@paul). Come say hello.

I tried out Mastodon years ago, but I didn't stick with it. For the last year, I've been looking for a way to host my own 'social notes' and other thoughts ([my journal](https://paul.kinlan.me/journal/)) on my own domain and at the same time that news started to percolate that Twitter was going to charge for the blue check and that it might cost $8 I wondered how much it would cost to self host my own Mastodon service.... Well, about $8 for a low end server. 

I'd much rather support and fund a small hosting business with the costs to run the service than paying Twitter.

I'm not quitting Twitter - there's still a lot of people that I learn from that are on there and are unlikely to move. But I'm also happy to participate less in what it's becoming and work where I want to work.

I'm really enjoying the opportunity afforded by self-hosting and participating in a platform being build around open and interoperable specifications.

I'm also enjoying that the Mastodon Web App is a very good PWA.
