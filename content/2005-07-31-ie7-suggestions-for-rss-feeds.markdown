summary: I've been exploring the RSS features in IE7 Beta 1 and have a couple of suggestions.
  First, it would be great if we could add feeds to favorites directly from the feeds
  toolbar button, rather than having to navigate to the feed itself.  It's an extra
  step when we've already decided we like the content enough to add it. Second, I'm
  curious about how IE7 discovers feeds on a page.  Sometimes it works, sometimes
  it doesn't. Is it just looking for a specific link tag in the head section or is
  there more to it? It seems to struggle with feeds linked via anchor tags. Overall,
  I'm enjoying IE7 so far, just want to offer some feedback.

title: IE7 Suggestions For RSS Feeds

---
After even more playing with IE7 Beta 1, I have some more annoyances I would like to get in the open.<p />These are mainly to do with the RSS support in IE7 Beta 1.  They are nothing major, but I would like to know why you can't right-click add to favorites straight from the feeds toolbar button.  If I am on a page looking at the HTML blog, I already know it is worth adding to my favorites, so can I please quickly add it to my favorites rather than going to feed and then adding it from there.<p />Also, does anyone know how IE7 discovers feeds on a page.  It works on some pages and not on others, is it simply looking for "&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml&gt;" in the head section or are there other methods.  It seems to have problems discoving RSS that is linked in via an anchor tag on the page.<p />Don't get me wrong I am really enjoying IE 7 so far.<p />
