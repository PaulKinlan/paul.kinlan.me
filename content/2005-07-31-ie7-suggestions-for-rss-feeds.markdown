After even more playing with IE7 Beta 1, I have some more annoyances I would like to get in the open.<p />These are mainly to do with the RSS support in IE7 Beta 1.  They are nothing major, but I would like to know why you can't right-click add to favorites straight from the feeds toolbar button.  If I am on a page looking at the HTML blog, I already know it is worth adding to my favorites, so can I please quickly add it to my favorites rather than going to feed and then adding it from there.<p />Also, does anyone know how IE7 discovers feeds on a page.  It works on some pages and not on others, is it simply looking for "&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml&gt;" in the head section or are there other methods.  It seems to have problems discoving RSS that is linked in via an anchor tag on the page.<p />Don't get me wrong I am really enjoying IE 7 so far.<p />
