summary: I just discovered the Technorati Tagger application (http://www.ultraseeker.com/tagbuilder).
  It's decent, converting user-generated tags into XHTML.  This represents the simpler
  half of what I'm aiming to build in my upcoming AJAX application.
tags:
- technorati
- tagger
- xhtml
- ajax
- application
- tags

I have just seen this tagger (<a href="http://www.ultraseeker.com/tagbuilder">http://www.ultraseeker.com/tagbuilder</a>). It is okay, all it does though is take tags that you generate and create some XHTML out of it. It has half of what I want in my next AJAX application, but that half is the easy half :)<p />
