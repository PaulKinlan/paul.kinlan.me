I have decided.<p />iforgive.eu is going to be a C#, ASP.Net 2.0 sample hosting site.  This blog, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk">www.kinlan.co.uk</a> will details the trials and tribulations of the work that is going into making the site.  It will be a step-by-step guide into how to make a site using ASP.Net 2.0.<p />This blog will show you the mistakes I make, how I refactor the design etc.  It will show you absolutly everything that I do with it [apart from passwords to the DB etc].  Hence the use of the name iforgive.eu [iforgiv.eu also] :)<p />The first thing that I will do is come up with a simple story about what I want from the site, then hopefully decide how I am going to design the site.  I will attempt to use a TDD approach to designing and developing a site.<p />More soon.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-115366351377264050?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
