summary: Web design faces several persistent challenges.  Tooling is complex and constantly
  evolving, making it difficult for designers to keep up. Demonstrating the value
  of design process to non-designers remains a hurdle. Cross-browser compatibility,
  especially for older browsers like IE11, continues to hinder progress.  Responsive
  design, while desired, is still difficult to implement effectively across all devices
  and contexts, and existing tools aren't always adequate.  Ultimately, the core issues
  boil down to process, tools, and achieving recognition for the value of design.

That&#x2019;s before we add prototyping tools to the mix. This may be something we just have to accept. After all, type standards only really started to settle in the 90s, and typography is a 500-year-old discipline.

I think this is something that we have to take on board: to learn how to educate and not just expect everyone to trust us by default. That takes time&#x200a;&#x2014;&#x200a;perhaps using scenario-based design or design workshops like a design sprint would help. Getting non-designers to observe users while using a prototype they created is one of the best experiences I have seen in this field.

I found this a very interesting post that is also a complement to a post I wrote about the [challenges for web developers](/challenges-for-web-developers/). It's not surprising that browser compat is an issue, but what is still a concern is that building for IE11 is still something that is holding the industry back. Likewise, Mustafa points out that there is still an issue with the tooling around Responsive Design and the emphasis on a single responsive solution always leads to the following (that is in Mustafa's post):

This is a problem that I think we all still wrestle with. On one hand we want everyone to build a responsive solution that can serve everyone on every device form-factor, on the other hand user context is important and often the user will only be willing to perform certain actions at certain times; we see this a lot in the retail and commerce industry: people will browse on mobile, and complete on desktop, and the question then becomes do you cater for this multi-modal model more or build a consistent experience across all devices... I suspect the answer is 'it depends', but either way it's a hard problem for everyone from product teams to engineering teams.
