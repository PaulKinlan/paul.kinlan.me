summary: This post explores the ever-evolving landscape of web technologies and their
  compatibility across different browsers and platforms. It examines tools like iwanttouse.com
  and other resources to determine what web features can be safely used in 2021.  The
  discussion will also include insights from industry experts like Jason and Mathias
  Bynens regarding JavaScript best practices.  Finally, the post proposes the innovative
  concept of adopting a \"quirks mode\" but tailored to specific years, which could
  offer greater control over web development.
