A colleague of mine, Phil Calver, has set up a site <a href="http://www.whatsatthetop.com">www.whatsatthetop.com</a> using ASP.Net 2.0 and Web parts.  It is a Top 10 Retail Mashup, taking data from sites like Amazon and CNet and Booksense.<p />Give it a check out and let him know of any suggestions that you have for the site.  He is looking for feedback.  If you have any other feed back such as charts that you would like to see let him know also.  <a href="mailto:webmaster@whatsatthetop.com">webmaster@whatsatthetop.com</a>
