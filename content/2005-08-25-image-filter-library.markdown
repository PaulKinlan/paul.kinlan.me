summary: 'I''ve previously mentioned the .NET Image Filter Library, and I highly recommend
  it to anyone interested in learning about programmatic image manipulation.  The
  library is well-documented in an easy-to-follow CodeProject article by Andrew Krillov.  You
  can find it here: [Image Processing Lab](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/media/Image_Processing_Lab.asp)
  and [Motion Detection](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/media/Motion_Detection.asp).
  I even created a fisheye filter for this API, which you can find here: [Fisheye
  Example](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/05/fisheye-example-code-that-integrates.html)'

I have talked about it in the past, but there is an Image Filter Library for .Net available.<p />I highly recomend it for anyone who wants to learn about Programatic Image Manipulation.<p />The article is at CodeProject and it is by Andrew Krillov.  The article is easy to follow and so is the code.<p />Here are the two links to the articles [CodeProject]<ul>
