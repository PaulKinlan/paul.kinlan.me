I have talked about it in the past, but there is an Image Filter Library for .Net available.<p />I highly recomend it for anyone who wants to learn about Programatic Image Manipulation.<p />The article is at CodeProject and it is by Andrew Krillov.  The article is easy to follow and so is the code.<p />Here are the two links to the articles [CodeProject]<br /><ul>
