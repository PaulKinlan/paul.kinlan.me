summary: I've created a flexible Cache Windows service that uses Named Pipes for interprocess
  and inter-machine communication.  This could be a useful solution for synchronizing
  web servers that need to access the same data but don't share state, cache, or session
  information.  Check out the full article for more details and implementation.
