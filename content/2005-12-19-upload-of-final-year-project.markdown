summary: I've finally uploaded my final year project, even amidst a house move and
  lack of internet!  It explores how neural networks can detect telecom fraud.  I've
  also built a related application, but I'll share more details later.  Stay tuned
  for more insights from the project.

title: Upload of Final Year Project

The house move is still going on, and I don't have an Internet connection :(.  Anyway, I have uploaded my <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/finalyearproject/final%20report%203.doc">Final Year Project</a>.  This was from a couple of years ago.  I will post interesting bits out of it.<p />It is about how Neural Networks can be used to detect fraud in the Telecom's industry.<p />There is an ancillary application that I have also created but I will have to talk about it at a later time.<p />
