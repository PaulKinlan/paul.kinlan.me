summary: The web's organic growth, with examples like Google Maps' early API and widespread
  embeddability, leads to questions about its current design. Would we recreate this
  structure today?  Likely not.  This suggests a need for change and migration, but
  how can this complex transition be managed effectively, especially considering the
  scale and interconnectedness of the web?
