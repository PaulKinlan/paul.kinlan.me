title: What I am Doing About AJAXTag
published: true
---
After my experience with <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">AJAX Tag 2 </a>[still not finished] and the quick turn around of <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/DeliTag">DeliTag</a> I have decided to alter the purpose of AJAX Tag.  AJAXTag was designed to help me give the user what related information they might want to see.  Well, I have had a change of mind.  I still might do that, and provide an OPML file of all the results that I collate, but I think it would also be good to let the readers of my blog explore for themselves.  <p />That means, I will definiatly include an Interactive version of my blog which will allow the users to explore and find out extra information about a journal entry that they are looking at.  Finally resulting in an OPML file that they can save and use.<p />This idea has been a long time in comming and is partially related to Memorandum, which Robert Scoble likes so much.  I never really liked mem' that much because not all the articles interested me, and if they didn't interest me what was the point in exploring the related data around these articles.  Hopefully if I provide my AJAXTagger in every entry then it I create, people who come to my site are potentially intereseted in what I write about and therfore will be more inclined to explore the relevant data around the article.<p />What do you think about this?  <a href="mailto:%20paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a><p />
