For a long time I've been thinking about what the future of the web looks like
when we go past what we know as the traditional web browser. I called this [The
Headless Web](/the-headless-web/) and I wanted to answer was "What if everything
was powered by 'The Web', but you never saw a browser?". Specifically I believe
that if you have access to a full browser, but no visible to "chrome" then there
is a huge opportunity for a new set of services.

It's taken a while, but I think we are getting there.

I'm enamored by Puppeteer. Puppeteer is a JavaScript library that sits on top
of the Chrome DevTools protocol and it allows you to automate and script the
Chrome browser.

My day-to-day work involves a lot of debugging web servers and ensuring. Like
many developers I use `curl` to make requests to a web server and check the
response. It's an amazing utility, however in today's world many developers are
building sites that are built using a lot of JavaScript and this makes it
impossible to inspect the complete response.

I decided to create a cUrl-like utility for fetching a resource and running the
JavaScript on the page called [`domcurl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/domcurl).

`domcurl` is a small NodeJS application that uses Puppeteer and can be installed
by issuing the following command: `npm i domcurl`. Like the `curl` command you
can issue a simple `domcurl [url]` to fetch the resource and run the JS on the
page.

It doesn't replicate all of `curl`, but it is quite featureful. Right now it has
the following features.

* Specify a url to fetch. i.e, `domcurl [url]`
* Inspect the response headers with `-v`. i.e, `domcurl -v [url]`
* Set cookies with `-b` i.e, `domcurl [url] -b "test=hello;
  Domain=airhorner.com; HttpOnly;" -b "hello=world; Domain=airhorner.com;
  HttpOnly;"`
* Add custom headers using the `-H` argument.
* Manually set the STDOUT with `-o` and STDERR with `--stderr`

I'm finding it quite useful, although it can't stream the results like `curl` can
because it has to wait for the CSS and JS to be downloaded and executed.

I also took the liberty to add a couple of extra features that are specific to JavaScript
and Chrome.

* Output a Chrome DevTools trace file (including screenshots.) `domcurl --url https://example.com --trace test.json`
* Include it as a JavaScript module if you have the need to integrate it into
  any of your existing applications.

```javascript
const {domcurl} = require('domcurl');
domcurl(`https://paul.kinlan.me/`, {});
```

API aside, I think [The Headless Web](/the-headless-web/) is here. We just need
to build for it.
