title: Amazon Web Service API SOAP vs REST
published: true
---
I have just been playing with the Amazon Web service API REST interface and I must say that it seem remarkably quicker than using the SOAP API.  I am saying this without doing much testing, but when ever I did calls from C# using a Web Reference it always seemed to take a while to pull back the results, the REST API on the otherhand is far far quicker.<p />Thinking about it I am using two completly different systems, one was a Windows Forms application, the other is a Linux Server on an unbelivably fast network connection.<p />
