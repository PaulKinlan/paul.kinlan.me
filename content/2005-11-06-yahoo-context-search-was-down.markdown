summary: My Wikipedia-based AJAX Tag and AJAX Tag 2 scripts were temporarily broken
  due to an issue with Yahoo's service.  Big thanks to the Yahoo developer team, especially
  Toby Elliot, for quickly resolving the problem!  Of all the Web 2.0 APIs I've used,
  Yahoo's has the most helpful and responsive support.

title: Yahoo Context Search Was down

For all the people (4) who are using AJAX Tag (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag</a>) and Ajax Tag 2 (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag</a>), who have noticed that the Wikipedia Articles are not being found it was due to a problem on Yahoo's end.  I must commend the people at developer.yahoo.net, Toby Elliot especially for getting this rectified.  I must also say, out of all the Online Web 2.0 API's that I have used Yahoo seem to be the most helpful, you report a problem and they are very honest and quick to fix any issues.  Way to go guys!<p />
