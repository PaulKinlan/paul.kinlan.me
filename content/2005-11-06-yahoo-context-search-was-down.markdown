For all the people (4) who are using AJAX Tag (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag</a>) and Ajax Tag 2 (<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag</a>), who have noticed that the Wikipedia Articles are not being found it was due to a problem on Yahoo's end.  I must commend the people at developer.yahoo.net, Toby Elliot especially for getting this rectified.  I must also say, out of all the Online Web 2.0 API's that I have used Yahoo seem to be the most helpful, you report a problem and they are very honest and quick to fix any issues.  Way to go guys!<p />
