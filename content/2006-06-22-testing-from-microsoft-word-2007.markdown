summary: Just tested the blogging feature from Microsoft Word 2007 and it's pretty
  cool if it works as expected.  I'm loving the new interfaces for Excel, Word, and
  PowerPoint, especially the ribbon.  Visio, however, seems a bit stale.  Smart Art
  looks promising, like CSS taken to the next level.  I might just switch to Word
  2007 for good!

<span><p>I am just testing the Blog feature from Word 2007.  If this works it is pretty cool.</p>
<p>I really love the interfaces to Excel, Word and PowerPoint.  The ribbon is sooo sweet. I am slightly disappointed so far with Visio.  Visio seems to be a simple rehash of earlier versions.</p>
<p>Smart Art is pretty cool, it is appears to be CSS to the max!</p>
<p>I may end up using Word 2007 permanently! </p></span>
