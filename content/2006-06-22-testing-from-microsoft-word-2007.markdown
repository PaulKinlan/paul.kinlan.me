title: Testing From Microsoft Word 2007
published: true

<span><p>I am just testing the Blog feature from Word 2007.  If this works it is pretty cool.</p>
<p>I really love the interfaces to Excel, Word and PowerPoint.  The ribbon is sooo sweet. I am slightly disappointed so far with Visio.  Visio seems to be a simple rehash of earlier versions.</p>
<p>Smart Art is pretty cool, it is appears to be CSS to the max!</p>
<p>I may end up using Word 2007 permanently! </p></span>
