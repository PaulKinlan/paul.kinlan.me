summary: After using IE7 Beta 1, I've found tabbed browsing, while a welcome addition,
  has a few quirks.  Modal dialog boxes lock the entire browser, not just the tab,
  which is disruptive.  Tabs don't have tooltips, making it hard to distinguish between
  similar pages.  Closing tabs requires going to the far right of the screen or right-clicking,
  neither of which is ideal. And finally, new tabs don't open to the homepage, which
  would be a useful option.

title: IE7 Beta 1 Minor Annoyances In Tabbed Browsing

---
After futher playing with IE7, I have come accross some other annoyances with Tabbed Browsing.<p /><ul>
<li>Modal Dialog boxes lock the whole of IE7, why can't they just make the tab that launched the dialog box locked out.</li>
<li>Hovering over the tab doesn't seem to pop a tooltip up,  If I have two pages open on the same site, with each site having a long title I can't really work out which of the two tabs has the content I need.</li>
<li>I would like a quick way to close a tab down<ul><li>a) without having to go to the right of the screen</li></ul>

</li>
<li>b) without having to right click on the tab</li>

</ul><li>Opening a new tab doesn't take you to your selected homepage.  I would like it as an option to be able to take you to your homepage.  I might for instance have google or some other information portal as my start page.</li><p />I accept the fact that some of these might have good arguments against having them, but I these are things that frustrate me a little whilst using IE7.<p />
