I have a bit of an issue with IE7's favorites.  If you have too many favorites to fit on one screen IE7 splits the favorites into multiple columns of favorites.  I think this is a bit of a bad design.  I kind of like the old IE6 method; scrolling menus.<p />Just take a look at this image to see what I mean.<p />[[posterous-content:BlAbqBvmdCpHbdzhrqpt]]<p />Pretty bad huh.  Okay I know that I have a lot of unorganised favorites and I should probably sort them... but still, I can't see the screen, the favorites menu even covers my my toolbar. Argh! :)<p />
