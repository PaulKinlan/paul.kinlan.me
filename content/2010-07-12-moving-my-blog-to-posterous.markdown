title: Moving my blog to posterous

---
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;">I have just moved all my blog content from <a href="http://kinlan.co.uk/" target="_blank" style="color: #406480;">kinlan.co.uk</a> to <a href="/" target="_blank" style="color: #406480;">paul.kinlan.me</a>.  My new site is hosted on Posterous which seems to be pretty darn cool.
<p />
<div>I should be blogging more and hopefully this will get me going a bit more :)</div>
