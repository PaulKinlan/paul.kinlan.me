summary: I'm moving my blog from Blogger to Wordpress!  While I've used Blogger for
  years, it no longer meets my needs. This blog will remain online but the new blog,
  covering broader software development topics (not just C#), is where I'll focus
  my writing. Find it at http://www.kinlan.co.uk/blog/ .

<p>I have been using Blogger for many years now on my own server. It has got to the point where I don't find the features of blogger fit in with my needs as a blogging platform so I am moving to Wordpress.</p> <p>I am keeping all the content here on this site and I may still update it from now and then.</p> <p>The new blog will still be more broadly focused against all aspects of the development of software not just c#.Â  The new blog can be found at the following URL: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/blog/">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/blog/</a></p>
