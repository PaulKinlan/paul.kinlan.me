summary: I missed a key feature of C# 2.0, despite all the content I read. The coolest
  part is the ability to have different access levels for property getters and setters.  This
  opens possibilities like public getters but protected setters. Abhinaba's blog has
  more details.

title: C# 2.0:I don't know why I didn't see this comming

For all my reading about C# 2.0, I don't know why I didn't see a properties set and get accessors can have differnt protection levels, for instance the getter can be public and the setter be protected.<p />That is a pretty cool feature.  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/basuabhinaba" target="_blank">Abhinaba's</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/abhinaba/archive/2005/11/10/491255.aspx">weblog </a>entry gives a few more detials.<p />
