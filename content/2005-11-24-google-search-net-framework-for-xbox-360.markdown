summary: This post addresses the numerous Google searches related to \".NET framework\"
  and \"Xbox 360.\" Despite the search traffic, I currently have no information on
  this topic.  It seems unlikely that .NET Framework would be available on the Xbox
  360 due to the console's different chip architecture and the recent introduction
  of x86 64-bit support in .NET 2.0.  However, I remain open to the possibility.

I have had a lot of hits from Google when people menation the .net framework and the XBox 360.<p />I might as well say what I know about it all. Nothing :(<p />I would have thought that the .Net Framework on the XBox 360 wasn't even on Microsoft's radar.  After all the XBox 360 is on a different Chip Architecure and they have only just managed to get x86 64bit support via the .Net 2.0 framework.<p />Maybe I am wrong though, you never know.<p />
