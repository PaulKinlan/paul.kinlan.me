I have had a lot of hits from Google when people menation the .net framework and the XBox 360.<p />I might as well say what I know about it all. Nothing :(<p />I would have thought that the .Net Framework on the XBox 360 wasn't even on Microsoft's radar.  After all the XBox 360 is on a different Chip Architecure and they have only just managed to get x86 64bit support via the .Net 2.0 framework.<p />Maybe I am wrong though, you never know.<p />
