summary: I'm exploring different web services, particularly for UK retailers like
  Tesco, Asda, or Virgin.  I've tried Amazon's, which is decent, and Yahoo's, which
  I like.  Ebay's looks interesting, but I'd rather not pay.  I'm also looking at
  Alexa's and Google's.  It's tough finding good resources on this, especially for
  UK retailers.  I'd love to see APIs from companies like Tescos, Asda, Dixons, and
  others.  If you know of any good web services, especially in the UK retail space,
  please share!
