published: true
---
Because I have been playing with Amazons web service, I was wondering if anyone else knew of any other good web services out there.<p />Specifically I am looking for UK based retail Web services like Amazon, a Tesco, Asda or Virgin etc one would be great.  But any will do, I am finding it hard to find any decent easy to read resources on the Internet :)  And that UDDI stuff, sheeeesh! :)<p />If anyone has any information on these can you post them in the comments.  I would be greatful, I will report any findings as I see.<p /><br />Retail<br /><ul>
