summary: I've added a new search feature to my site that uses the Yahoo API to find
  related articles based on keywords.  You can test it out at http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag.  It's
  a work in progress, but more features are coming soon!

title: Minor Test in the AJAX Tagger

---
I have just done a little experiment with the existing application.  I have in the past talked about Citations and problems finding previous articles that I have written so that I can cross reference what I have been talking about.  I have added in some functionality that will search kinlan.co.uk, to find in articles that are related by keywords that have been selected by the tagger.<p />All this is using the [Yahoo API](http://developer.yahoo.net) and it works pretty well.  For each tag that the I select from the article that is inputted in to the Ajax tagger, a link is shown for each of the posts that contain that key.<p />Give it a go if you want:  [http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag) and use this entry as an example input.<p />This is just a test at the moment, but some other more important aggregation features will be in the next version of the application.<p />
