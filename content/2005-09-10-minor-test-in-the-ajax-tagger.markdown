title: Minor Test in the AJAX Tagger
published: true
---
I have just done a little experiment with the existing application.  I have in the past talked about Citations and problems finding previous articles that I have written so that I can cross reference what I have been talking about.  I have added in some functionality that will search kinlan.co.uk, to find in articles that are related by keywords that have been selected by the tagger.<p />All this is using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net">Yahoo API</a> and it works pretty well.  For each tag that the I select from the article that is inputted in to the Ajax tagger, a link is shown for each of the posts that contain that key.<p />Give it a go if you want:  <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag</a> and use this entry as an example input.<p />This is just a test at the moment, but some other more important aggregation features will be in the next version of the application.<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
