  an alternative to RSS/ATOM feeds.  Would you subscribe to email updates if offered?

title: Feed or Email Delivery

I have just a quick question that I am hoping people will give me feed back to.<p />If I provided an email subscription list that notified you of updates to my blog would you subscribe to this?<p />I am basically wondering if it is worth creating an email list for people who want to keep track of my site without having to use my RSS or ATOM feeds.<p />
