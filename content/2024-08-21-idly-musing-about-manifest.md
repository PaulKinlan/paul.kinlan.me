title: Idly musing about Manifest
---

I sometimes go for a spelunk in to HTTP Archive looking at values here and there. I thought I would look at default manifest.json values.

```JavaScript
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  `httparchive.response_bodies.2024_08_01_desktop`
WHERE
  url LIKE '%manifest.json'
  AND response_body LIKE '%"short_name": "React App"%'
```

There are 551037 urls that end \'manifest.json\' and 22303 of those manifest files have the default manifest file generated by Create React App.

It\'s probably worth exploring how many manifests are the default manifest created by build tooling.
