summary: In this blog post, I share some findings from my exploration of HTTP Archive
  data.  I discovered that a significant number of websites using manifest.json files
  are using the default configuration generated by Create React App.  I plan to investigate
  this further and determine how prevalent default manifest files are across the web.

title: Idly musing about Manifest

---

I sometimes go for a spelunk in to HTTP Archive looking at values here and there. I thought I would look at default manifest.json values.

```JavaScript
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  `httparchive.response_bodies.2024_08_01_desktop`
WHERE
  url LIKE '%manifest.json'
  AND response_body LIKE '%"short_name": "React App"%'
```

There are 551037 urls that end \'manifest.json\' and 22303 of those manifest files have the default manifest file generated by Create React App.

It\'s probably worth exploring how many manifests are the default manifest created by build tooling.
