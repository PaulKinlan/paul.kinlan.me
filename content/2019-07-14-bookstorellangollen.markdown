summary: I revisited a bookstore in Llangollen, located above a cafe, that I fondly
  remember from my childhood visits with my grandparents. It's charmingly unchanged,
  but I wish they had a larger selection of comics, like they did back then. Check
  out their website!

I love this place, it's on top of a cafe in Llangollen. I came here with my grandparents nearly 30 years ago and it's pretty much the same now.

My only wish is that there was even more Commix books - I swear there was a heap more when I was a kid.
