summary: I've decided to create iforgive.eu, a C# ASP.Net 2.0 sample site, and document
  the entire process on my blog.  This includes design, development, refactoring,
  and even my mistakes!  I'll begin by outlining the site's purpose, planning its
  design, and employing a TDD approach.  Follow along as I build this site from the
  ground up!

I have decided.<p />iforgive.eu is going to be a C#, ASP.Net 2.0 sample hosting site.  This blog, <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk">www.kinlan.co.uk</a> will details the trials and tribulations of the work that is going into making the site.  It will be a step-by-step guide into how to make a site using ASP.Net 2.0.<p />This blog will show you the mistakes I make, how I refactor the design etc.  It will show you absolutly everything that I do with it [apart from passwords to the DB etc].  Hence the use of the name iforgive.eu [iforgiv.eu also] :)<p />The first thing that I will do is come up with a simple story about what I want from the site, then hopefully decide how I am going to design the site.  I will attempt to use a TDD approach to designing and developing a site.<p />More soon.
