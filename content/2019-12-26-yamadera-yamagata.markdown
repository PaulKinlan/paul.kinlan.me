summary: I took a day trip to the 1000-year-old Yamadera Temple in Yamagata, Japan.  The
  climb to the top wasn't too difficult and offered breathtaking views of the valley.
  It was a quiet day with few other visitors, unlike busier weekends and holidays.
  The oldest building there is around 400 years old.

Early in December we took a short day-trip to Yamadera Temple in Yamagata prefecture.&nbsp;

The temple area is said to be about 1000 years old, with the oldest remaining building being about 400 years old. The temple is built on to the side of a mountain that you have to walk up (it's not too strenuous to reach the top), but it presents amazing views across the valley from the top.

The day we went it was rather quiet (we maybe saw 30 people), but we were told it can get a lot busier during the weekends and holidays.
