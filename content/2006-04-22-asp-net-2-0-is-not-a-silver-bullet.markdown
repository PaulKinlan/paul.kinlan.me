title: ASP.NET 2.0 Is NOT a Silver Bullet
published: true

I was just reading Karl Seguins Blog and I came across this:<br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Before the first concrete information about 2.0 came out, promises about massive code reduction were being made.  "I can't say too much at this point...one of our aggressive goals is to reduce the number of lines of code between v1 and v2 by 70%"... Fast forward to today, you'll quickly realize there is no silver bullet.</blockquote><p />I couldn't agree more.  There are alot of things about ASP.Net 2.0 that I don't like, personalisation for one!  But Karls blog makes some good reading.  He mentions that more than 1/2 his time is doing DAL and BLL stuff and ASP.Net 2.0 doesn't help there.  However, I do tend disagree. ASP.Net 2.0 is supposed to help even at that level, and the increased number of server controls helps reduce code too.<p /><p /><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2006/04/20/143118.aspx">read more</a> | <a href="http://digg.com/programming/ASP.NET_2.0_Is_NOT_a_Silver_Bullet">digg story</a>
