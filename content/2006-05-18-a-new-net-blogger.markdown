A Friend (Paul Pierce) of mine has launched a new blog it will contian plenty of stuff, but he said he will be talking about .Net a bit.  His second post contains info about how to use NMock 2.<p />I think it reads really well and is better than my blog, but I could always just be fishing for praise :)<p />Anyway, check it out if you get chance.  <a href="http://www.paulpierce.co.uk">http://www.paulpierce.co.uk</a><p />
