title: Are you an UK Amazon Marketplace Seller?
published: true
---
I have created a place where any Amazon Marketplace seller can link to a list of all their products.<p />Currently it is only for the UK, but making it US based will not be hard at all.<p />If you know you market place seller ID: mine is A30C94ZTNLBKQM, then you can link to http://www.kinlan.co.uk/amazon/uk/Selled ID and get a page that can be indexed by search engines easily.<p /><br />For example: <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/amazon/uk/A30C94ZTNLBKQM">http://www.kinlan.co.uk/amazon/uk/A30C94ZTNLBKQM</a> will take you to a list of my products.<p />More information will be going in soon, so that it will display products better.  But for now it is an easy way to see up to 20 of your products on any one page.<p />Have a play.<p />
