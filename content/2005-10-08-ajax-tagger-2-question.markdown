Currently, the next version that is being created is quite complex [<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2">Ajax Tagger 2.0</a>].  It provides the user with the ability to add a lot of extra data to a journal entry.  I am just wondering if you guys would like a simple version my original Tagger <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">[Original Ajax Tagger]</a>.<p />Any comments?<p />
