Currently, the next version that is being created is quite complex [[Ajax Tagger 2.0](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2)].  It provides the user with the ability to add a lot of extra data to a journal entry.  I am just wondering if you guys would like a simple version my original Tagger [[Original Ajax Tagger]](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag).<p />Any comments?<p />
