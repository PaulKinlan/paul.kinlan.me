title: Worker Threads in JavaScript?

Does anyone know if it is possible to simulate worker threads in JavaScript.  I need a method of constantly polling a particular resource and dispatching events based on conditions in that resource.<p />Currently I am thinking that I will have to have methods triggered off timers.  Is this acceptable?<p />
