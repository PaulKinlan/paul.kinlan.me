summary: I'm still waiting for a response from Start.com regarding my UI improvement
  suggestion.  Even though Robert Scoble mentioned their quick response to feedback,
  I haven't heard anything about my suggestion to improve the functionality of the
  close (\"x\") button on content panes.  I've sent an email and even blogged about
  it, but no luck so far.  Hopefully, they'll address it soon!

title: Start.com, Still that minor issue exists

---
Even after start.com has been updated and Robert Scoble said the Start.com team <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/13.html#a11136">respond quickly to feedback</a><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
They also posted Start.com/developer and are looking for feedback on all this stuff. They react fast and seem like they are adding new features every few days.
</blockquote><p />I still haven't had a reply [or any sign of implementation] to my UI improvement suggestion.  I don't think I am being silly, all I would like to hear is someone say, yeah it is good or yup kinlan you'r a fool :).  I know you guys are busy, but everyone elses suggestions seemed to get taken on board.<p />Anyway, here is the email about feedback I sent.<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
Hi, I really love what you are doing on start.com, but I still have a minor greavance with the way the "x" button on the content panes work. It seems that every pane will close even if I don't confirm the click action by releasing the mouse. It is quite annoying because you can easily remove content panes by mistake.
