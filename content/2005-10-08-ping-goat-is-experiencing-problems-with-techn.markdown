summary: My blog, Ping Goat, is having trouble getting indexed by Technorati, similar
  to the issues I've faced with Tagger.com. It seems Technorati might remove blogs
  from their index if their crawler encounters unresponsive parts of a site.  I'm
  unsure how to resolve this besides raising the issue publicly, as their email support
  is very slow or non-existent.

title: Ping Goat is Experiencing Problems with Technorati

---
Over on Pingoat, he is having problems with Technorati not indexing them or any of the pings [<a href="http://www.pingoat.com/goatlog/post/index/26/Technorati-problem" title="PingGoat">http://www.pingoat.com/goatlog/post/index/26/Technorati-problem</a>].  I had this problem a while back and I am still getting it over on <a href="http://www.tagger.com" title="Tagger Blog">www.tagger.com</a>.  I think it might stem from if they try to spider your site and some part of it is not responsive then they take you out of their list of "blogs which work".  I am not too sure how to get it back in, unless you constantly complain in high profile places!  Their response to emails is notoriously slow/non-existant.<p />
