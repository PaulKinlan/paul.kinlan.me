title: Ping Goat is Experiencing Problems with Technorati
published: true

Over on Pingoat, he is having problems with Technorati not indexing them or any of the pings [<a href="http://www.pingoat.com/goatlog/post/index/26/Technorati-problem" title="PingGoat">http://www.pingoat.com/goatlog/post/index/26/Technorati-problem</a>].  I had this problem a while back and I am still getting it over on <a href="http://www.tagger.com" title="Tagger Blog">www.tagger.com</a>.  I think it might stem from if they try to spider your site and some part of it is not responsive then they take you out of their list of "blogs which work".  I am not too sure how to get it back in, unless you constantly complain in high profile places!  Their response to emails is notoriously slow/non-existant.<p />
