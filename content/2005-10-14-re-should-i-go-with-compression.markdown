summary: James Manning left a comment on my blog post about compression, pointing
  to a Microsoft article about built-in decompression support in .NET 2.0 for SOAP
  replies. While I appreciate the comment, Yahoo APIs don't use SOAP, so it won't
  be helpful in that context. However, this information could be useful for working
  with Amazon APIs, which do have a SOAP interface.

Following a [comment ](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/10/should-i-go-with-compression.html#c112908078131661908)on my blog from <a href="http://blog.sublogic.com/">James Manning</a><blockquote>
<div>It should be pretty straightforward. With 2.0 there's built-in support for decompression of SOAP replies. Check out the article that got posted last year @ [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=)/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/wsnetfx2.asp</div>

</blockquote><i>[Via [C#, .Net Framework](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Kinlan?m=121)]</i><p />Thanks for the comment, however unfortuantly Yahoo doesn't use SOAP to access their API's.  However, it is really handy to know because it might be of use with Amazons API's which do have a SOAP interface.<p />
