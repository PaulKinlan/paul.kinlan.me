summary: I've made a couple of small changes to the blog. I removed the personal journal
  section and added my projects to the RSS feed so you can see what I've been working
  on with Generative AI. Happy New Year!

title: Some clean-up new-year

---

There\'s not that many people who read this blog - but for those of you who do, I\'m making some minor changes.

* Removed the journal - I stopped personal journalling in the middle of the year (I still do it for work) - I don\'t think there was a huge amount of value in the bulleted lists for everyone else, so I\'ve removed it from the blog.

* Added [projects](https://paul.kinlan.me/projects/ "https://paul.kinlan.me/projects/") to the RSS feed. I\'ve had a pretty productive end of 2023 and I did a lot of work related to Generative AI, and I\'d like to share them a little more broadly.

... Also, Happy New Year, while I have you reading this.
