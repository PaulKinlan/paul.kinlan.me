There is one thing I have never seen.  A JavaScript OPML Object Model!  I am just in the process of creating one for my AJAX Tagger version 2.  I need the object model, because I need to create the document on the fly and then save out in a variety of ways.  I also need it to be easily modifyable so that it updates in real-time as the user uses the application.<p />
