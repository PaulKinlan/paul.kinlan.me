summary: The Ajax Tagger has been updated with a number of bug fixes and improvements.  Key
  changes include using my own Tag Directory for related tags, providing Yahoo search
  results as RSS in OPML output, and fixing issues with menu item classes, OPML apostrophe
  escaping, and image selection persistence. Planned future enhancements include a
  Blogger interface, Kelkoo integration, addressing a cross-domain CGI request security
  warning, and Del.icio.us OPML integration.
