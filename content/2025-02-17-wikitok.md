Link: [WikiTok](https://wikitok.vercel.app/)

This is such an amazing site and has become a bit of a daily habit for me. It's a brilliantly simple idea that means I'm browsing more of Wikipedia than I ever have before.

I built a similar demo a while ago using the now-defunct Portals API because I want to explore what a Web Browser could be if it had a UI like TikTok. My hypothesis was that while links are amazing, what is behind them is hidden, and worse (imo) it's behind a banner image that is often not representative of the content.

So the idea was that as long as you had a list of sites that you might visit it might be neat to have a way to flick between them quickly and get an idea if you actually want to dive into the content. The portals API seemed like a good way to do it because it could run JS, but was non-interactive and in theory privacy-preserving.

I adapted it in mid-2024 to use generated screenshots of the pages. I also thought I should give it a snappy name. Flick the Web's code is [here](https://glitch.com/~flick-the-web) and the you can play with the [demo](https://flick-the-web.glitch.me/) that runs over the latest articles on HackerNews.

I'm really glad that WikiTok did this and also it has been [open sourced](https://github.com/IsaacGemal/wikitok) as I can totally imagine that this type of UI takes off on the web.
