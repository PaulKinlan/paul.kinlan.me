published: true

<div style=""><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">In February I did a quick presentation for the TwitterDevNest about how you can get your Data in and out of Buzz - however I forgot to get the slides up. The slides are a bit bare, as I was talking for most of it, however, we covered: - WebFinger - OpenID - Buzz feeds, consuming and producing - Pubsubhubbub - Salmon I also said I will open source the code. I will put that on Github a little later today, it demonstrates most of the above points (with the exception of Salmon).</span></div>
