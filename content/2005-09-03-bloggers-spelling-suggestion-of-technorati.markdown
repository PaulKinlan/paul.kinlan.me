summary: While spell-checking my latest blog post, Blogger suggested \"Degenerate\"
  as a correction for \"Technorati.\"  I found this amusing, given the generally poor
  quality of Blogger's spell-check.  It doesn't even recognize words like \"blog\"
  or British English spellings.  At least it keeps things interesting!

title: Bloggers Spelling Suggestion of Technorati

---
I was spell checking my [last entry](http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2005/09/another-thing-i-just-noticed.html), and Blogger's spelling suggestion for Technorati was Degenerate.<p />It made me chuckle.<p />Bloggers spell checker is so poor, it doesn't recognise Blog [or British English Spelling]. At least it keeps me on my toes.<p />
