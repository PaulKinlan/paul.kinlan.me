What do you do if you want to quickly test your sites on mutliple versions of Android at the same time?

There are couple of solutions, such as [Adobe Edge Inspect](http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/), but what if you want to create and manage your own in your own workflow?  I haven't seen single solution yet.

Here is a simple shell script that I created that starts to get you on your way to your own testing lab.  It connects to every single Android device that is attached to your machine by using `adb` (Android Debugging tool).

The process is as follows (and please suggest better ways):

*  Kill any existing adb servers
*  Get a list of attached devices
*  For each device set up port forwarding (required for [Chrome Dev tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging))
*  Fire Android intent to open the browser (with a url if one is on the command line)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4706201.js"></script>

It's not a complete solution, but it is a nice way to start.  My ultimate goal is to have a [Raspberry PI](http://www.xda-developers.com/android/adb-fully-working-on-raspberry-pi/) hosting adb and all the devices that I can attach to it with an attached proxy that will route all my devtools requests to the correct device.

How do you test across multiple devices?
