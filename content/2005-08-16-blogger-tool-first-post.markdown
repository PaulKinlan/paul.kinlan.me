This is my first post using the Blogger Word Blogging tool.  It is pretty cool, pretty easy to use.  I would like to know If I have any control of the HTML that is created.  Only because the AJAX tool that I use only outputs HTML.  It will be interesting to see what people can do with it.  At least I have a decent spell checker! <p />One thing I have noticed is that if you put a smiley icon in the text it only comes out as a “(“.<p />Edit: apostrophes don’t come out very well either.<br />Edit: Images and tables aren’t supported either.  Gutted.<p />I think I will post a blog tomorrow with the features that I would like to see.<p />Edit:  It is really fast at publishing the post too.  I mean I find that it is really really fast.
