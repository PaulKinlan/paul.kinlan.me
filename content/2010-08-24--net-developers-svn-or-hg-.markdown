Just a quick question for the .Net developers out there, both Windows and Mono.<p /><div>Given a choice of Subversion or Mercurial, what would be your preferred source control service and why?  Which helps you work the best?  Which has the  least impact on your workflow?</div> <p /><div>Sorry guys, I know that some of you may use others SCM&#39;s, but I am just interested in these two?</div>
