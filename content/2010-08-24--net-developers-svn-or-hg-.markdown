summary: I'm curious to hear from .Net developers, both those working with Windows
  and Mono, about their preferred source control service between Subversion (SVN)
  and Mercurial (HG).  I'd love to know which one you find most effective and has
  the least impact on your daily workflow. While I know other SCMs exist, I'm specifically
  interested in opinions on these two.

Just a quick question for the .Net developers out there, both Windows and Mono.<p /><div>Given a choice of Subversion or Mercurial, what would be your preferred source control service and why?  Which helps you work the best?  Which has the  least impact on your workflow?</div> <p /><div>Sorry guys, I know that some of you may use others SCM&#39;s, but I am just interested in these two?</div>
