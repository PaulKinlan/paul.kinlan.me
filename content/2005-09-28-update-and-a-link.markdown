A lot of stuff has been happening recently, and I haven't had much of a chance to update my blog or version 2 of AJAXTagger.<p />I am currently working on version 2 when I get some free time :)   [<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag2" title="Ajax Tagger Version 2">you can see a very early version here</a>].<p />I have had to over come some minor issues with the JavaScript, but I am starting to build up a pretty cool framework.  I do need to point you to <a href="http://blog.dreamprojections.com/archive/2005/01/17/530.aspx">http://blog.dreamprojections.com/archive/2005/01/17/530.aspx</a> because this post hepled me work out how to call JavaScript Object methods using setInterval.  I am using this in the Priorty Queueing system I am making :)<p />
