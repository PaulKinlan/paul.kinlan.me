summary: Google's new data protocol, GData, has me wondering about the future of Blogger.  Will
  Blogger integrate with GData?  Blogger already uses Atom, so will that make integration
  easier?  Or will Blogger's slow pace of development prevent them from adopting GData
  anytime soon?  I'm skeptical.

title: Will Blogger Integrate with GData

---
If you read the introduction to GData, Googles new Data Protocol you will see the following paragraph:<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">For example, a blogging application might provide a feed for each blog, and a comment feed for each blog entry. A calendar application might allow you to send full-text search queries using the GData protocol, and return results in the GData syndication format.
</blockquote>I know that Blogger already supports Atom and its associated protocol, but does this comment indicate that they are planning on integrating Blogger futher into Google? Or is it that because Blogger is based on Atom that it will easily support GData with little modification?<p />I don't know, I think Blogger are behind the times with everything that they do.  And I can't see them changing in the near future.<p />
